Not thinking to amuse the proud light,
The attention of the friendship of the beloved,
I'd like to introduce you
The pledge is worthier than you,
More worthy than a beautiful soul,
A saint of fulfilled dreams,
Poetry is alive and clear,
High thoughts and simplicity;
But so be it with a biased hand
Accept the collection of motley chapters,
Half-funny, half-sad,
The common people, the ideal,
The careless fruit of my amusements,
Insomnia, light inspirations,
Immature and withered years,
The mind of cold observations
And the hearts of the sorrowful will be noticed.


My uncle has the most honest rules,
When I was seriously ill,
He forced himself to respect himself
And I couldn't think of a better one.
His example to others is science;
But, my God, what a bore
To sit with the patient day and night,
Without taking a step away!
What a low cunning
To amuse the half - dead,
He needs to fix his pillows,
It's sad to bring medicine,
Sigh and think about yourself:
When the devil will take you!

That's what the young rake thought,
Flying in the dust on the post office,
By the Almighty will of Zeus
The heir of all his relatives.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
With the hero of my novel
Without preface, this is the hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
He was born on the banks of the Neva River,
Where maybe you were born
Or shone, my reader;
I used to walk there too:
But the north is bad for me.

Having served perfectly nobly,
His father lived in debt,
Gave three balls annually
And finally squandered.
Eugene's fate kept him safe:
At first Madame followed him,
Then Monseur changed it.
The child was harsh, but sweet.
Monseur Abbe, a poor Frenchman,
So that the child does not get exhausted,
I taught him everything jokingly,
I didn 't bother with strict morals,
He scolded me a little for pranks
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.

When is the rebellious youth
It's time for Eugene,
It's time for hopes and tender sadness,
Monseur was chased out of the yard.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Cut in the latest fashion,
How dandy london is dressed
And finally I saw the light.
He speaks French perfectly
He could express himself and wrote;
I danced the mazurka easily
And he bowed casually;
What do you want more? The light has decided,
That he's smart and very nice.

We all learned a little bit
Something and somehow,
That's the way of education, thank God,
It's easy to shine here.
Onegin was in the opinion of many
(resolute and strict judges)
A learned fellow, but a pedant:
He had a lucky talent
Without compulsion in conversation
Touch everything lightly,
With the scholarly air of a connoisseur
To remain silent in an important dispute
And make the ladies smile
The fire of unexpected epigrams.

Latin is out of fashion now:
So, to tell you the truth,
He knew quite a lot of Latin.,
To sort out the epigraphs,
To talk about Juvenal,
At the end of the letter, put ae,
Yes, I remembered, though not without sin,
There are two verses from the Aeneid.
He had no desire to rummage
In chronological dust
Everyday life of the earth:
But the days of the past are anecdotes
From Romulus to the present day
He kept it in his memory.

Having no high passion
For the sounds of life, do not spare,
He couldn't get rid of the chorea,
No matter how hard we fought, to distinguish.
He scolded Homer, Theocritus;
But I've read Adam Smith.
And there was a deep economy,
That is, he was able to judge that,
How the state gets richer,
And what does he live by, and why
He doesn't need gold.,
When a simple product has.
His father couldn't understand him
And he gave the land as collateral.

Everything else Eugene knew,
I don't have time to tell you;
But what was his true genius,
What did he know more firmly than all the sciences,
What was the difference for him
And labor, and flour, and joy,
Which took the whole day
His yearning laziness,
There was a science of tender passion,
Which Nazon sang,
Why did he end up a sufferer
Its age is brilliant and rebellious
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far from his own Italy.


How early could he be a hypocrite,
To harbor hope, to be jealous,
To disbelieve, to make believe,
To appear gloomy, to languish,
To appear proud and obedient,
Attentive or indifferent!
How languidly silent he was,
How ardently eloquent,
In heartfelt letters, how careless!
One breathing, one loving,
How could he forget himself!
How his gaze was quick and gentle,
He is shy and impudent, and sometimes
He shone with an obedient tear!

How could he seem new,
Joking innocence amaze,
Scare with desperation ready,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To catch a moment of tenderness,
Innocent years of prejudice
The mind and passion to win,
Involuntary affection to expect,
Beg and demand recognition,
Eavesdrop on the heart's first sound,
Chasing love, and suddenly
To achieve a secret date
And then she's alone
Give lessons in silence!

How early could he have disturbed
The hearts of the record coquettes!
When I wanted to destroy
He has his rivals,
How sarcastically he slandered!
What kind of nets I prepared for them!
But you, blessed husbands,
You were friends with him.:
He was caressed by his evil husband,
Phoblas is a long-time student,
And an incredulous old man,
And the cuckold is majestic,
Always happy with himself,
His lunch and his wife.


He used to be still in bed:
They bring notes to him.
What? Invitations? Really,
Three houses are calling for the evening:
There will be a ball, there will be a children's party.
Where will my prankster go?
Who will he start with? Anyway:
It's no wonder to keep up everywhere.
For now, in the morning dress,
Wearing a wide bolivar,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
And there he walks in the open,
While the vigilant breget
Lunch won't ring for him.

It's already dark: he's getting into the sled.

It is silvered with frosty dust
His beaver collar.
He rushed to Taon: he is sure,
What's waiting for him there?
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
A current splashed from the comet;
In front of him, roast beef is bloody,
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
French cuisine is the best color,
And Strasbourg is an imperishable pie
Between the Limburg cheese alive
And a golden pineapple.

Thirst asks for more glasses
Pour the hot fat over the cutlets,
But the ringing of the breguet brings them,
That the ballet has started a new one.
The theater is an evil legislator,
A fickle admirer
Charming actresses,
Honorary citizen of the wings,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Where everyone is breathing freely,
Ready to slap entrechat,
To lick Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To call Moina (in order to,
Just so you can hear him).

A magical land! There in the old years,
Satires the bold lord,
Fonvizin, a friend of freedom, shone,
And the enterprising Prince;
There are involuntary tribute lakes
People's tears, applause
I shared it with the younger Semenova;
There our Katenin resurrected
Cornelius is a majestic genius;
There he brought out a sharp Shakhovskoy
Their comedies are a noisy swarm,
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
There, there under the wings
My younger days were rushing by.

My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
Hear my sad voice:
Are you still the same? Are the other virgins,
Having replaced, did they not replace you?
Will I hear your choirs again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
A soulful flight?
Or a dull gaze will not find
Familiar faces on the boring stage,
And, staring at an alien light
A disappointed lorgnette,
An indifferent spectator of fun,
I will yawn silently
And to remember the past?

The theater is already full; the boxes are shining;
Stalls and chairs
There is an impatient splashing in the neighborhood,
And the curtain rises And makes a noise.
Brilliant, semi-airy,
I obey the magic bow,
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
Istomina is standing; she,
One foot touching the floor,
The other is slowly circling,
And suddenly a leap, and suddenly it flies,
Flies like fluff from the mouth of Aeolus;
Then the camp will develop, then it will develop
And he beats the leg with a quick foot.

Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
He walks between the chairs on his legs,
Double lorgnette obliquely induces
To the lodges of unknown ladies;
I looked at all the tiers,
I saw everything: faces, headdress
He's terribly unhappy.;
He bowed to the men from all sides,
Then to the stage
I looked at it in great distraction,
He turned away and yawned,
And he said:
I've been putting up with ballets for a long time,
But I'm tired of Didlo too.

More cupids, devils, snakes
There is jumping and noise on the stage;
More tired footmen
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
They haven't stopped stomping yet,
Blowing your nose, coughing, shushing, clapping;
More outside and inside
Lanterns are shining everywhere;
Still, having vegetated, the horses are fighting,
Bored with their harness,
And the coachman, around the lights,
They scold the gentlemen and beat them in the palm of their hands
And Onegin went out;
He's going home to get dressed.

Will I depict the faithful in the picture
A secluded study,
Where is the student exemplary
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Everything for the whim of the abundant
London trades scrupulously
And on the Baltic waves
He carries us for the forest and lard,
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
A useful trade having chosen,
Invents for fun,
For luxury, for fashionable bliss,
Everything decorated the office
A philosopher at the age of eighteen.

Amber on the tubes of Tsargrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
And, pampered feelings are a joy,
Perfume in faceted crystal;
Combs, steel nail files,
Straight scissors, curves
And brushes of thirty kinds
Both for nails and teeth.
Rousseau (I'll note in passing)
I couldn't understand how important Makeup is
Dared to clean his nails in front of him,
An eloquent madcap.
Defender of liberty and rights
In this case, he is completely wrong.

You can be a good person
And think about the beauty of nails:
Why is it fruitless to argue with the age?
The custom is despot among people.
The second Chadaev, my Evgeny,
Afraid of jealous judgments,
He was a pedant in his clothes
And what we called a frant.
It's been three hours at least
I spent time in front of mirrors
And he came out of the bathroom
Like a windy Venus,
When wearing a man's outfit,
The goddess is going to a masquerade.

In the last taste of the toilet
Taking your curious gaze,
I could be in front of a learned light
Describe his outfit here;
Of course it would be brave,
Describing is my business:
But pantaloons, tailcoat, waistcoat,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see that I am blaming myself before you,
Well, my poor style
I could have been much less colorful
In foreign words,
Even though I looked in a long time ago
In the Academic Dictionary.

Now we have something wrong in the subject:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
Where to go headlong in the Yamskaya carriage
My Onegin has already galloped.
In front of the darkened houses
Along the sleepy street in rows
Double carriage lights
Cheerful pouring out the light
And rainbows bring snow;
Dotted with bowls all around,
A magnificent house is shining;
Shadows walk across the solid windows,
Head profiles flicker
And ladies and fashionable weirdos.

Here our hero drove up to the entrance hall;
He shot past the doorman
He flew up the marble steps,
Straightened his hair with his hand,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
The music is too tired to rattle;
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
There is noise and crowding all around;
The spurs of the cavalry are strumming;
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
Following their captivating footsteps
Fiery eyes are flying,
And the roar of the skripok drowned
Out the jealous whispers of fashionable wives.

During the days of fun and desires
I was crazy about balls:
Or rather, there is no place for confessions
And for the delivery of the letter.
Oh, you honorable spouses!
I will offer you my services;
Please notice my speech:
I want to warn you.
You are also, mothers, stricter
Look after your daughters:
Hold your lorgnette straight!
That's not it, God forbid!
That's why I'm writing this,
That I haven't sinned for a long time.

Alas, for various amusements
I've ruined a lot of my life!
But if morals didn't suffer,
I would still love balls.
I love the frenzied youth,
And the tightness, and the brilliance, and the joy,
And I'll give you a thoughtful outfit.;
I love their legs; only hardly
You will find the whole of Russia
Three pairs of slender female legs.
Ah! I couldn't forget for a long time
Two legs Sad, cold,
I remember them all, and in my dreams
They disturb my heart.

When and where, in what desert,
Madman, will you forget them?
Oh, legs, legs! Where are you now?
Where are you crushing the spring flowers?
Nurtured in oriental bliss,
In the northern, sad snow
You didn't leave any traces:
Did you like soft carpets
A luxurious touch.
Have I forgotten for you for a long time
And thirst for fame and praise,
And the land of the fathers, and imprisonment?
The happiness of the young years has disappeared,
As in the meadows, your light footprint.

Diana's breasts, Flora's lanites
Lovely, dear friends!
However, the leg of Terpsichore
It's more charming than anything to me.
She, prophesying to the gaze
An invaluable reward,
Attracts conditional beauty
Desires are a self-willed swarm.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Under the long tablecloth of the tables,
In the spring on the grasslands,
In winter, on the cast iron fireplace,
There is a hall on the mirrored parquet floor,
By the sea on the granite rocks.

I remember the sea before the storm:
How I envied the waves,
Running in a stormy line
Lay down at her feet with love!
As I wished then with the waves
To touch sweet feet with your lips!
No, never in the heat of the day
My boiling youth
I didn't want to be in such agony.
Kissing the mouths of the younger Armids,
Or roses of flaming lanit,
Or percy, full of longing;
No, never a rush of passion
He didn't torment my soul like that!

I remember another time!
Sometimes
I hold a happy stirrup in my cherished dreams
And I feel the leg in my hands;
Imagination is boiling again,
Her touch again
It ignited the blood in the withered heart,
More longing, more love!..
But it is enough to glorify the arrogant
With your loquacious lyre;
They are not worth any passion,
No songs inspired by them:
The words and gaze of these witches are
As deceptive as their legs.

What about my Onegin? Half asleep
He's going to bed from the ball:
And St. Petersburg is restless
Already awakened by the drum.
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
A cab pulls to the stock exchange,
Ohtenka is in a hurry with the jug,
The morning snow crunches under it.
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
The shutters are open;
The pipe smoke rises in a column of blue,
And the bread maker, the German is neat,
In a paper cap, more than once
He was already opening his vasisdas.

But, tired of the noise of the ball
And the morning turns at midnight,
Sleeping peacefully in the shadow of the blessed
Fun and luxury child.
He'll wake up in the afternoon, and again
His life is ready until morning,
It is monotonous and variegated.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Among the brilliant victories,
Was he in the midst
Of daily pleasures? Was he in the midst of feasts
Careless and healthy?

No: his feelings cooled down early;
He was bored with the light and the noise;
The beauties didn't stay long
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
Have you had time to tire of infidelity;
Friends and friendship are boring,
Because he couldn't always
Beef steaks and Strasbourg pie
Pour champagne over a bottle
And pour out sharp words,
When my head hurt;
And even though he was an ardent rake,
But he finally fell out of love
And swearing, and a saber, and lead.

A disease that causes
It would have been time to find it long ago,
Similar to the English spline,
In short: Russian melancholy
It took hold of him little by little;
He's going to shoot himself, thank God,
I didn't want to try it,
But he has completely cooled down to life.
Like Chd-Harod, sullen, languid
He appeared in the living rooms;
No gossip of the world, no Boston,
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Nothing touched him,
He didn't notice anything.


The vagaries of the big world!
He left all of you before;
And the truth is that in our summers
The higher tone is rather boring;
At least, maybe another lady
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
But in general their conversation
Obnoxious, though innocent nonsense;
Besides, they are so immaculate,
So majestic, so smart,
So full of piety,
So circumspect, so precise,
So unapproachable for men,
That the sight of them gives birth to a splinter.

And you, young beauties,
Which I sometimes get late
The dashing droshky is being carried away
Along the St. Petersburg pavement,
And my Eugene has left you.
The renegade of stormy pleasures,
Onegin locked himself in at home,
Yawning, he took up the pen,
I wanted to write, but it was hard work
He was sick of it; nothing
It did not come out of his pen,
And he did not get into the perky workshop
People I don't judge,
Because I belong to them.

And again, devoted to idleness,
Languishing in mental emptiness,
He sat down with a laudable purpose
To appropriate the mind of someone else;
He lined the shelf with a squad of books,
I read and read, but all to no avail:
There's boredom, there's deception or nonsense;
There is no conscience in that, there is no sense in that;
There are different chains on all of them;
And the old thing is outdated,
And the old ones are delirious with novelty.
Like the women, he left the books,
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
He drew it with a mourning taffeta.

The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
How is he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
I became friends with him at that time.
I liked his features,
His involuntary devotion to Dreams,
Inimitable strangeness
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was angry, he was sullen;
We both knew the passion game;
The life of both of us was tormenting;
In both hearts, the heat faded;
Malice awaited both of them
Blind Fortune and people
In the very morning of our days.

Those who have lived and thought cannot
Don't despise people in your heart;
Those who felt it are worried
The Ghost of Irrevocable Days:
That one has no charms,
That snake of memories,
That one is gnawing at remorse.
All this often gives
The great charm of conversation.
First, Onegin's language
It confused me; but I'm used to it
To his sarcastic argument,
And jokingly, with bile in half,
And the anger of dark epigrams.

How often do I fly sometimes,
When it is transparent and light
The night sky over the Neva
And the water is funny glass
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
Memories of previous years novels,
Remembering the old love,
Sensitive, careless again,
The breath of the benevolent night
We were silently reveling!
How to get into the green forest from prison
The sleepy well was moved,
So we were carried away by a dream
To the beginning of a young life.

With a soul full of regrets,
And lean on the granite,
Eugene stood thoughtfully,
How Pete described himself.
Everything was quiet; only the night
The sentries called to each other,
Yes droshky a distant knock
From the Millionth there was a sudden;
Just a boat waving its oars,
I was floating on a dormant river:
And we were captivated in the distance
The horn and the song are bold
But sweeter, in the midst of nocturnal fun,
The melody of the Torquat octaves!

Adriatic waves,
Oh, Brenta! No, I'll see you.
And, full of inspiration again,
I will hear your magical voice!
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
By the proud lyre of Albion
He's familiar to me, he's my family.
Golden Nights of Italy
I'm not going to enjoy myself on the outside,
With the young Venetian,
Sometimes talkative, sometimes mute,
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
With her my lips will find
The language of Petrarch and love.

Will the hour of my freedom come?
It's time, it's time!
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
Beckoning to the sails of ships.
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
Along the free crossroads of the sea
When will I start running free?
It's time to leave boring breg
I don 't like the elements
And in the midst of the midday swells,
Under the sky of my Africa,
Sigh for gloomy Russia,
Where I suffered, where I loved,
Where I buried my heart.

Onegin was ready with me
To see foreign countries;
But soon we were the fate
Divorced for a long time.
His father died then.
Before Onegin gathered
There is a greedy regiment of lenders.
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Eugene, hating lawsuits,
Pleased with his lot,
Gave them the Inheritance,
The big loss is not seeing
Or having known it from afar
The death of the old man's uncle.

Suddenly he really got it
A report from the steward,
That my uncle is dying in bed
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
After reading the sad message,
Eugene is immediately on a date
I galloped headlong through the mail
And I was yawning in advance,
Getting ready, for the sake of money,
To sighs, boredom and deception
(And that's how I started my novel);
But after arriving at my uncle's village,
I found it on the table,
As a tribute to the finished land.

He found a yard full of services;
To the deceased from all sides
Enemies and friends gathered,
Hunters before the funeral.
The deceased was buried.
Priests and guests ate and drank
And then they separated importantly,
It's like they're busy.
Here is our Onegin, a villager,
Factories, waters, forests, lands
The owner is full, but up to now
Order is an enemy and a waster,
And I am very glad that the old way
Changed it to something else.

Two days seemed new to him
Secluded fields,
The coolness of the gloomy winter,
The murmur of a quiet stream;
On the third there is a grove, a hill and a field
He was not interested in more;
Then they induced sleep;
Then he saw clearly,
The boredom in the village is the same,
Although there are no streets or palaces,
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
Melancholy was waiting for him on guard,
And she was running after him,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.

I was born for a peaceful life,
For rural silence;
In the wilderness, a lyrical voice is more sonorous,
Creative dreams come alive.
Devoting your leisure time to the innocent,
I wander over a deserted lake,
And far from my law.
I am awake every morning
For sweet bliss and freedom:
I don't read much, I sleep a long time,
I don't catch flying glory.
Wasn't that how I was in the old days
Spent in inactivity, in the shadows
My happiest days?

Flowers, love, village, idleness,
Fields! I am devoted to you with all my soul.
I'm always happy to notice the difference.
Between Onegin and me,
To the mocking reader
Or some publisher
Elaborate slander,
Comparing my features here,
I didn 't repeat it godlessly afterwards,
That I painted my portrait,
Like Byron, the poet of pride,
As if it's impossible for us
Writing poems about other things,
As soon as it's about yourself.

I'll note by the way: all poets
Love is a dreamy friend.
Sometimes, cute objects
I dreamed, and my soul
I kept their secret image;
After that, the muse revived them:
So I, careless, sang
And the virgin of the mountains, my ideal,
And the captives of the shores of Salgir.
Now from you, my friends,
I often hear the question:
Who is your lyre sighing for?
To whom, in a crowd of jealous virgins,
Did you dedicate her tune?

Whose gaze, stirring inspiration,
He rewarded me with a tender caress
Your pensive singing?
Who did your verse idolize?
And, friends, no one, by God!
Love the insane anxiety
I had a dreary experience.
Blessed is he who has combined with her
The fever of rhymes: he doubled it
Poetry is a sacred delusion,
Petrarch marching after,
And he calmed the agony of his heart,
Caught and glory meanwhile;
But I, loving, was stupid and dumb.

Love has passed, the muse has appeared,
And the dark mind cleared up.
I'm free, I'm looking for an alliance again
Magical sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
Near unfinished poems,
No female legs, no heads;
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
I'm still sad; but there are no tears anymore,
And soon, soon the storms will follow
My soul will completely calm down:
That's when I'll start writing
A poem of songs at twenty-five.

I was already thinking about the form of the plan
And what will I call the hero;
For now, my novel
I have finished the first chapter;
I reviewed all this strictly:
There are a lot of contradictions,
But I don't want to fix them.
I will pay my debt to censorship
And for the journalists to eat
I will give you the fruits of my labors:
Go to the Nevsky shores,
A newborn creation,
And earn me a tribute of glory:
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!


The village where Eugene was bored,
There was a lovely corner;
There is a friend of innocent pleasures
I wish I could bless heaven.
The manor house is secluded,
Protected from the winds by a mountain,
He stood over the river. Far away
They were full of flowers and bloomed before him
Meadows and fields of gold,
Villages flashed by; here and there
Herds roamed the meadows,
And the canopy expanded thick
A huge, neglected garden,
The shelter of thoughtful dryads.

The venerable castle was built,
How castles should be built:
It is extremely durable and calm
In the taste of smart antiquity.
There are high chambers everywhere,
There are damask wallpapers in the living room,
Portraits of kings on the walls,
And stoves in colorful tiles.
All this is now dilapidated,
I really don't know why;
Yes, however, to my friend
There was very little need for that,
Because he was yawning anyway
Among the fashionable and ancient halls.

He settled in that room,
Where is the village old-timer
I've been fighting with the housekeeper for forty years,
I looked out the window and crushed flies.
It was simple: the floor was oak,
Two closets, a table, a down sofa,
There's not a speck of ink anywhere.
Onegin opened the cupboards;
I found a notebook in one of them.,
There's a whole line of liqueurs in the other,
Jugs of apple water
And the calendar of the eighth year:
An old man with a lot to do,
I didn't look at other books.

Alone among his possessions,
Just to spend time,
Our Eugene conceived it first
To establish a new order.
In his wilderness, the sage is desolate,
I am a member of the ancient corvee
I replaced it with a light fee;
And the slave blessed fate.
But he sulked in his corner,
Seeing the terrible harm in this,
His calculating neighbor;
The other smiled slyly,
And in a voice, everything was decided like this,
That he's a dangerous weirdo.

At first, everyone went to see him;
But since it's from the back porch
It was usually served
He needs a Don stallion,
Just along the main road
Their household will hear them,
Being offended by such an act,
Everyone stopped being friends with him.

He's a pharmacist; he drinks one
A glass of red wine;
He does not fit the ladies to the handle;
Everything is yes, yes, no; he will not say yes, sir
Or not, sir. That was the general voice.

To his village at the same time
The new landowner rode in
And equally strict analysis
I gave a reason in the neighborhood:
By the name of Vladimir Lensky,
With a soul straight from Gottingen,
Handsome, in full bloom,
An admirer of Kant and a poet.
He is from Germany foggy
He brought the fruits of scholarship:
Freedom-loving dreams,
An ardent and rather strange spirit,
Always an enthusiastic speech
And the curls are shoulder-length black.

From the cold debauchery of the world
It hasn 't faded yet,
His soul was warmed
Greetings from a friend, the affection of virgins;
He was an ignoramus at heart, dear,
He was cherished by hope,
And the world's new brilliance and noise
Still captivated the young mind.
He amused himself with a sweet dream
Doubts of your heart;
The purpose of our life is for him
It was a tempting mystery,
He was puzzling over it
And he suspected miracles.

He believed that his soul was his own
You must connect with him,
What, drearily languishing,
She waits for him every day;
He believed that his friends were ready
For the honor of accepting his shackles
And that their hand will not waver
To break the vessel of the slanderer;
What are the chosen of fate,
People are sacred friends;
That their immortal family
Irresistible rays
Someday it will light us up
And the world will bestow bliss.

Indignation, regret,
For the good, pure love
And glory is a sweet torment
His blood was stirred early.
He and lyra traveled the world;
Under the sky of Schiller and Goethe
Their poetic fire
The soul was ignited in him;
And the muses of sublime art,
Lucky man, he did not shame:
He proudly preserved in the songs
Always lofty feelings,
Impulses of a virgin dream
And the beauty of important simplicity.

He sang love, obedient to love,
And his song was clear,
Like the thoughts of a simple-minded virgin,
Like a baby's dream, like the moon
In the serene deserts of the sky,
The goddess of secrets and gentle sighs.
He sang separation and sadness,
And something, and a vague distance,
And romantic roses;
He sang those faraway countries,
Where is it long in the bosom of silence
His living tears flowed;
He sang the faded color of life
Almost at the age of eighteen.

In the desert, where Eugene is alone
Could appreciate his gifts,
The lords of the neighboring villages
He didn't like feasts.;
He ran away from their noisy conversation.
Their conversation is reasonable
About haymaking, about wine,
About the kennel, about his family,
Of course, he did not shine with any feeling,
Not with poetic fire,
Neither sharpness nor intelligence,
No art dorms;
But the conversation of their lovely wives
He was much less intelligent.

Rich, handsome, Lensky
He was accepted everywhere as a groom;
This is the village custom;
All the daughters were expecting their own
For a semi-Russian neighbor;
Will he rise, immediately the conversation
Gets the word sideways
About the boredom of a single life;
The neighbor is called to the samovar,
And Dunya pours tea;
They whisper to her:
Then they bring a guitar:
And she will squeak (my God!):
Come to my golden hall!..

But Lensky, of course, did not have,
Hunting the bonds of marriage are not enough,
I wished to meet Onegin cordially
Make acquaintance shorter.
They got together. Wave and Stone,
Poetry and prose, ice and fire
They are not so different from each other.
First, by mutual disagreement
They were boring each other.;
Then they liked it; then
We rode together every day
And soon they became inseparable.
So people (I'm the first to repent)
There's nothing to do, friends.

But there is no friendship between us either.
All prejudices have been eliminated,
We honor everyone with zeros,
And units of themselves.
We're all looking at the Napoleons.;
There are millions of bipedal creatures
There is only one weapon for us;
The feeling is wild and funny to us.
Eugene was more tolerable than many;
Although he knew people, of course
And generally despised them,
But (there are no rules without exceptions)
He was very different from others
And he respected that feeling too.

He listened to Lensky with a smile.
The poet's passionate conversation,
And the mind is still shaky in its judgments,
And an eternally inspired gaze,
Everything was new to Onegin;
He's a chilling word
I tried to keep it in my mouth
And I thought: it's stupid to bother me
To His momentary bliss;
And it's time to come without me;
Let him live for now
May the world believe in perfection;
Let's forgive the fever of youth
And young fever and young delirium.

Everything between them gave rise to disputes
And I was attracted to thinking:
Tribes of the past treaties,
Fruits of science, good and evil,
And age-old prejudices,
And the coffin secrets are fatal,
Fate and life in its own way,
Everything was subject to their judgment.
A poet in the heat of his judgments
I was reading, forgetting myself, meanwhile
Excerpts from northern poems,
And the condescending Eugene,
Although I didn't understand a lot of them,
He listened diligently to the young man.

But more often they were occupied by passions
The minds of my hermits.
Gone from their rebellious power,
Onegin talked about them
With an involuntary sigh of regret:
Blessed is He who has known their agitation
And finally I got behind them;
Blessed is the one who did not know them,
Who cooled love by separation,
Enmity sometimes
Yawned with friends and with his wife,
Jealous without worrying about the flour,
And grandfather's faithful capital
I didn't trust the treacherous two.

When will we run to the banner
Prudent silence,
When the flame of passion is extinguished,
And they become funny to us
Their wilfulness or impulses
And belated reviews,
The humble are not without difficulty,
We like to listen sometimes
The passions of others are rebellious,
And he moves our hearts.
That's right the old invalid
A diligent ear readily tends to
According to the stories of young moustaches,
He was forgotten in his hut.

But also a fiery youth
Can't hide anything.
Enmity, love, sadness and joy
She's ready to talk.
In love, being considered an invalid,
Onegin listened with an important air,
How, the hearts of a loving confession,
The poet expressed himself;
Your trusting conscience
He was innocently exposing himself.
Eugene found out without difficulty
His love is a younger story,
A story full of feelings,
They have not been new to us for a long time.

Ah, he loved, as in our summers
No longer love; as one
The mad soul of a poet
I'm still condemned to love:
Always, everywhere there is one dream,
One habitual wish,
One habitual sadness.
No cooling distance,
No long summers of separation,
Not to the muses of this watch,
No foreign beauties,
No noise of fun, no science
The souls have not changed in him,
Warmed by a virgin fire.

A little boy, captured by Olga,
I haven 't known heartache yet,
He was an affectionate witness
Her infant amusements;
In the shade of a protective oak grove
He shared her fun,
And crowns were predicted for the children
Friends are neighbors, their fathers.
In the wilderness, under the shadow of a humble,
Innocent charm is full,
In the eyes of her parents, she
Bloomed like a hidden lily of the valley,
The unknown in the grass is deaf
Neither moths nor bees.

She gave it to the poet
The first dream of young delights,
And the thought of her inspired
His handlebars made the first moan.
Sorry, the games are golden!
He loved the thick groves,
Privacy, silence,
And the night, and the stars, and the moon,
The moon, the heavenly lamp,
To which we dedicated
Walking in the middle of the evening darkness,
And tears, secret torments are a joy
But now we see only in it
Replacement of dim lights.

Always humble, always obedient,
Always as cheerful as the morning,
How the life of a poet is simple-minded,
How is the kiss of love sweet;
Eyes like the sky, blue,
Smile, flaxen curls,
Movements, voice, light stance,
Everything is in Olga, but any novel
Take it and find it right
Her portrait: he is very nice,
I used to love him myself,
But I'm tired of him immensely.
Allow me, my reader,
To take care of the older sister.

Her sister's name was Tatiana
For the first time with such a name
The gentle pages of the novel
We will wilfully sanctify.
And what about it? it is pleasant, sonorous;
But with him, I know, it is inseparable
An old memory
Or a girl's! We all have to
To admit: the taste is very little
With us and in our names
(Not to mention poems);
Enlightenment is not appropriate for us,
And we got it from him.
Affectation, nothing more.

So, her name was Tatiana.
Not her sister's beauty,
Neither by the freshness of her rosy
It would not have attracted the eyes.
Wild, sad, silent,
How timid is the doe of the forest,
She's in her own family
She seemed like a stranger to the girl.
She couldn't make out
To his father, not to his mother;
The child herself, in a crowd of children
I didn't want to play or jump
And often alone all day
She sat silently by the window.

Thoughtfulness, her friend
From the most lullaby days,
The current of rural leisure
I decorated her with dreams.
Her pampered fingers
They did not know needles; leaning on an embroidery frame,
With a silk pattern, she
She did not enliven the canvases.
Hunting to rule is a sign,
With an obedient doll child
It is being prepared jokingly
To the decency of the law of light,
And importantly repeats to her
My mother's lessons.

But dolls even in these years
Tatiana did not take it in her hands;
About the news of the city, about fashion
I didn't have a conversation with her.
And there were childish pranks
Alien to her: scary stories
In winter in the dark of the nights
They captivated her heart more.
When did the nanny collect
For Olga on a wide meadow
All her little friends,
She didn't play with the burners,
She was also bored by the ringing laughter,
And the noise of their windy pleasures.

She loved on the balcony
To warn the dawn sunrise,
When in the pale sky
The dance of stars disappears,
And quietly the edge of the earth brightens,
And, herald of the morning, the wind blows,
And the day gradually rises.
In winter, when the night shadow
Half the world has a share,
And a share in idle silence,
With a clouded moon,
The lazy East is resting,
Awakened at the usual hour
She got up by candlelight.

She liked novels early on;
They replaced everything for her;
She fell in love with deceptions
And Richardson and Rousseau.
Her father was a kind fellow,
In the last century, the belated;
But I didn't see any harm in books;
He, without ever reading,
He considered them an empty toy
And I didn't care about that,
What a secret tom my daughter
Had Dozed off under her pillow until morning.
His wife was herself
I'm crazy about Richardson.

She loved Richardson.
Not because I read it.,
Not because Grandison
She preferred Lovelace;
But in the old days, Princess Alina,
Her Moscow cousin,
I often told her about them.
There was also a groom at that time
Her husband, but in captivity;
She sighed for another,
Who is with his heart and mind
She liked him much more:
This Grandison was a nice dandy,
A gambler and a sergeant of the guards.

How was she dressed
Always in fashion and to the face;
But without asking her advice,
The Girl was taken to the wedding.
And to dispel her grief,
The sensible husband left soon after
To her village, where she,
God knows who she's surrounded by,
I was torn and cried at first,
I almost divorced my husband;
Then I took care of the household,
I got used to it and became satisfied.
Habit is given to us from above:
It is a substitute for happiness.

Habit has soothed grief,
Not reflected by anything;
The opening is big soon
She was completely comforted:
She is between business and leisure
I discovered the secret as a spouse
To govern autocratically,
And then everything started to get better.
She went to work,
Salted mushrooms for the winter,
She kept expenses, shaved foreheads,
I went to the bathhouse on Saturdays,
She beat the maids angrily
All this without asking my husband.

I used to pee in blood
She's in the albums of gentle maidens,
She called Polina Praskovya
And she spoke in a singsong voice,
She wore a very narrow corset,
And Russian is like French
She could pronounce it through her nose;
But soon everything changed:
Corset, album, Princess Alina,
Sensitive poems notebook
She forgot: she started calling
The shark of the old Selina
And finally updated
There is a dressing gown and a cap on the cotton wool.

But her husband loved her cordially,
It wasn't part of her plan,
He believed in everything blithely,
And he ate and drank in his dressing gown;
His life went on peacefully;
In the evening, sometimes they converged
Neighbors are a kind family,
Inconsiderate friends,
And to harass, and to curse,
And laugh about something.
Time passes; meanwhile
Olga will be ordered to make tea,
There's dinner, it's time to sleep there,
And the guests are coming from the courtyard.

They kept it in a peaceful life
The habits of the dear old;
They have a fat carnival
There were Russian pancakes;
Twice a year they talked;
They loved round swings,
There are songs, a round dance;
On the day of Trinity, when the people,
Yawning, listen to the prayer service,
Sweetly on the beam of dawn
They shed tears three times;
They needed kvass like air,
And they have guests at the table
They carried dishes according to rank.

And so they both aged.
And finally they opened
In front of the spouse of the coffin door,
And he took a new crown.
He died an hour before dinner,
Mourned by his neighbor,
Children and faithful wife
More sincere than the other.
He was a simple and kind gentleman,
And where his ashes lie,
The tombstone reads:
The Humble Sinner, Dmitry Larin,
The Lord's slave and foreman,
Under the stone, this one tastes peace.

Returned to his penates,
Vladimir Lensky visited
The neighbor's monument is humble,
And he dedicated a sigh to the ashes;
And for a long time my heart was sad.

He held me in his arms.
How often did I play as a child
His Ochakov medal!
He was expecting Olga for me.,
He said: will I wait for the day?..
And full of sincere sadness,
Vladimir immediately wrote
He has a tombstone madrigal.

And there is also a sad inscription
Father and mother, in tears,
He honored the patriarchal ashes
Alas! on the reins of life
The instant harvest of a generation,
By the secret will of providence,
They rise, mature and fall;
Others follow them
So our windy tribe
It grows, worries, boils
And the great-grandfathers are crowding towards the coffin.
Our time will come, our time will come,
And our grandchildren in a good hour
We will also be ousted from the world!

Revel in it for now,
Have an easy life, friends!
I mean her insignificance
And I'm not attached to her much.;
I closed my eyes to the ghosts;
But distant hopes
They disturb the heart sometimes:
Without an inconspicuous trace
I would be sad to leave the world.
I do not live and write for praise;
But I think I would like to
To glorify your sad lot,
To take care of me like a faithful friend,
It reminded me of at least one sound.

And he will touch someone's heart.;
And, saved by fate,
Maybe it won't sink in the Summer
The stanza composed by me;
Perhaps (a flattering hope!),
The future ignoramus will indicate
To my famous portrait
And he says: that was a poet!
Please accept my thanks,
A fan of peaceful aonides,
O you, whose memory will preserve
My flying creations,
Whose benevolent hand
He'll rub the old man's laurels!



Goodbye, Onegin, I have to go.
But where are you
Do you spend your evenings?
That's wonderful.
Have mercy! And it's not difficult for you
Is there a killing every night?
I can't understand it.
Now I see what it is:
First of all (listen, am I right?),
A simple, Russian family,
There is great zeal for the guests,
Jam, eternal conversation
About the rain, about flax, about the barnyard

I don't see any trouble here yet.


The home circle is dearer to me,
Where can I find an eclogue!
Come on, honey, for God's sake.
Well? You're going: it's a pity.
Oh, listen, Lensky; but you can't
To see this Phyllida for me,
The subject of both thoughts and pen,
And tears and rhymes et cetera?..
Introduce me.
Even now.
They will gladly accept us.

Let's go.
Others galloped off,
They appeared; they were wasted
Sometimes difficult services
Hospitable antiquity.
The rite of famous treats:
They carry jam on saucers,
They put a waxed one on the table
A jug of cranberry water.


They are the most expensive of the briefest
They're flying home at full speed.
Now let's eavesdrop stealthily
The heroes of our conversation:

But you miss me
You're bigger somehow. No, it's the same.
However, it's too dark in the field;
Hurry up! Go, go, Andrew!
What stupid places!
And by the way: Larina is simple,
But a very sweet old lady;
I'm afraid: lingonberry water
She wouldn't hurt me.

Tell me: which one is Tatiana?
Yes, the one who is sad
And silent, like Svetlana,
She came in and sat by the window.

I would have chosen another one.,
If only I were like you, a poet.
Olga has no life in her features.
Just like in the Vandik's Madonna:
She is round, her face is red,
Like this stupid moon
In this stupid sky.
Vladimir replied dryly
And then he was silent the whole way.

Meanwhile, Onegin's appearance
The Larins produced
Everyone is very impressed
And all the neighbors were entertained.
Guess after guess went on.
Everyone began to interpret furtively,
Joking, judging is not without sin,
Tatiana is expecting a groom;
Others even claimed,
That the wedding is completely coordinated,
But then it was stopped,
That they didn't get fashionable rings.
About Lensky's wedding a long time ago
They had already decided.

Tatiana listened with annoyance
Such gossip; but secretly
With inexplicable joy
I couldn't help thinking about that;
And the thought sank into my heart;
It's time, she fell in love.
So the fallen grain falls into the ground
Spring is enlivened by fire.
It's been a long time since her imagination,
Burning with longing and longing,
The thirst for food is fatal;
It's been a long time since a heartache
Her younger breasts were cramped;
The soul was waiting for someone,

And I waited
She said: It's him!
Alas! Now it's days and nights,
And a hot lonely dream,
Everything is full of them; everything is sweet to the virgin
Incessantly with magical power
Keeps talking about him. Bothering her
And the sounds of gentle speeches,
And the gaze of a caring servant.
She is plunged into despondency,
She doesn't listen to the guests
And curses their leisure time,
Their unexpected arrival
And a long sitting.

Now what kind of attention is she paying
Reading a sweet novel,
With what lively charm
Drinking a seductive deception!
With the happy power of dreaming
Animated creatures,
Julia Volmar's lover,
Malek-Adele and de Linard,
And Werther, the rebellious martyr,
And the incomparable Grandison,
Which makes us sleepy,
Everything for a gentle dreamer
They put on a single image,
They merged into one Onegin.

Imagining herself to be a heroine?
Of her beloved creators,
Clarice, Julia, Delphine,
Tatiana in the silence of the woods
One wanders with a dangerous book,
She searches for it and finds it
Your secret heat, your dreams,
The fruits of the fullness of the heart,
Sighs and appropriates to himself
Someone else's delight, someone else's sadness,
Into oblivion he whispers by heart
A letter for a sweet hero
But our hero, whoever he is,
It certainly wasn't Grandison.

Your own style in an important mood,
He used to be a fiery creator
He showed us his hero
As a model of perfection.
He gifted a favorite subject,
Always unjustly persecuted,
With a sensitive soul, with a mind
And an attractive face.
Feeding the heat of the purest passion,
Always an enthusiastic hero
I was ready to sacrifice myself,
And at the end of the last part
Vice has always been punished,
A wreath was worthy of kindness.

And now all minds are in a fog,
Morality makes us sleepy,
Vice is amiable in the novel too,
And there he triumphs.
The British Muse is a tall tale
They disturb the sleep of the adolescent,
And now he has become her idol
Or a brooding Vampire,
Or Melmoth, the gloomy tramp,
Or the Eternal Jew, or the Corsair,
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Lord Byron by a lucky whim
Clothed in a dull romanticism
And hopeless selfishness.

My friends, what's the use of that?
Perhaps by the will of heaven,
I will stop being a poet.,
I'm going to be possessed by a new demon,
And, Phoebe's defying threats,
I will stoop to humble prose;
Then the novel is in the old way
It will take my merry sunset.
Not the torments of secret villainy
I will portray it menacingly,
But I'll just tell you about it
The traditions of the Russian family,
Love captivating dreams
Yes, the customs of our antiquity.

I will retell simple speeches
Father or old uncle,
Children's appointments
By the old lime trees, by the stream;
Unhappy jealousy of torment,
Separation, tears of reconciliation,
I'll quarrel again, and finally
I'll lead them down the aisle.
I will remember the speeches of the passionate bliss,
Words of longing love,
Which in days gone by
At the feet of a beautiful mistress
They came to my tongue,
Which I am now unaccustomed to.

Tatiana, dear Tatiana!
I'm crying with you now;
You're in the hands of a fashionable tyrant
I've already given up my fate.
You will perish, my dear; but first
You're in a blaze of hope.
You call the dark bliss,
You will learn the bliss of life,
You drink the magic poison of desires,
You are haunted by dreams:
You imagine everywhere
Happy Dating Shelters;
Everywhere, everywhere in front of you
Your tempter is fatal.

The longing of love drives Tatiana away,
And she goes into the garden to be sad,
And suddenly her eyes are motionless,
And she is too lazy to step further.
Chest lifted, lanita
Instant flame covered,
The breath froze in my mouth,
And there is noise in the hearing, and a sparkle in the eyes
Night will come; the moon is going around
The watch of the distant vault of heaven,
And the nightingale in the darkness of the trees
The melodies are sonorous.
Tatiana does not sleep in the dark
And he speaks quietly to the nanny:

I can't sleep, Nanny: it's so stuffy in here!
Open the window and sit down with me.
I am bored,
Let's talk about the old days.
What is it about, Tanya? I used to,
I kept a lot of things in my memory
Old stories, tall tales
About evil spirits and about girls;
And now everything is dark for me, Tanya:
I forgot what I knew. Yes,
A bad turn has come!
Tell me about it, Nanny,
About your old years:
Were you in love then?

And, come on, Tanya! These summers
We haven't heard about love;
Otherwise, she would have driven me out of the world
My dead mother-in-law.

God must have ordered it that way. My Vanya
He was younger than me, my light,
And I was thirteen years old.
The matchmaker went for two weeks
To my family, and finally
My father blessed me.
I cried bitterly out of fear,
They unwound my braid crying
Yes, they took me to church with a stump.

And so they introduced a stranger into the family
You're not listening to me.
Oh, nanny, nanny, I'm longing,
I feel sick, my dear:
I'm ready to cry, I'm ready to cry!..

God have mercy and save us!
What do you want, ask
Let me sprinkle with holy water,
You're not sick at all:
I am.

And babysitter the girl with a plea
She baptized with an old hand.

Whispered again
To the old woman with grief she is.
Dear friend, you are not well.

And meanwhile the moon was shining
And lit up with a languid light
Tatiana's pale beauties,
And loose hair,
And drops of tears, and on the bench
Before the young heroine,
With a kerchief on his head, gray-haired,
An old woman in a long padded jacket;
And everything was dozing in silence
Under the inspiring moon.

And her heart was far away
Tatiana, looking at the moon
Suddenly a thought was born in her mind
Go on, leave me alone.
Give me a pen, a paper, nanny,
Yes, move the table; I'll go to bed soon;
Sorry. And here she is alone.
Everything is quiet. The moon is shining on her.
Leaning on her elbows, Tatiana writes,
And everything is on Eugene's mind,
And in a thoughtless letter
The love of an innocent virgin breathes.
The letter is ready, folded
Tatiana! Who is it for?

I knew beauties who were inaccessible,
Cold, clean, like winter,
Implacable, incorruptible,
Incomprehensible to the mind;
I marveled at their fashionable arrogance,
Their natural virtues,
And, I admit, I ran away from them,
And, I think, I read with horror
Above their eyebrows is the inscription of hell:
Give up hope forever.
Inspiring love is a disaster for them,
Scaring people is a joy for them.
Perhaps on the banks of the Neva
You have seen similar ladies.

Among the fans of the obedient
I've seen other freaks,
Selfishly indifferent
For passionate sighs and praises.
And what did I find with amazement?
They, by stern command
Scaring timid love,
They were able to attract her again
At least with regret,
At least the sound of the speeches
Sometimes he seemed more gentle,
And with a gullible dazzle
A young lover again
I was running after a nice fuss.

For what is Tatiana more guilty?
For the fact that in sweet simplicity
She knows no deception
And does he believe in his chosen dream?
For the fact that he loves without art,
Obedient to the attraction of feeling,
That she is so trusting,
That she is gifted from heaven
A rebellious imagination,
With a living mind and will,
And a wayward head,
And with a fiery and tender heart?
Don't you forgive her
Are you frivolous of passions?

The coquette judges in cold blood,
Tatiana loves without joking
And it is certainly committed
Love, like a sweet child.
She does not say: let's postpone
We will multiply the price of love,
Or rather, we'll start it online;
First, let's prick the vanity
Hope, there is perplexity
We will torment the heart, and then
We will revive it with Jealous fire;
And then, bored with pleasure,
The slave is cunning from the shackles
I'm ready to break out every hour.

I also foresee difficulties:
Saving the honor of the native land,
I will undoubtedly
Have to translate Tatiana's letter.
She didn't speak Russian well.,
I haven't read our magazines
And he expressed himself with difficulty
In your native language,
So, I wrote in French
What to do! I repeat again:
Until now, ladies' love
I didn't explain myself in Russian,
Our language is still proud
I'm not used to postal prose.

I know: they want to force the ladies
Read in Russian. Really, fear!
Can I imagine them
With in hand!
I'm falling for you, my poets;
Isn't it true: cute objects,
To whom, for their sins,
Did you write poetry in secret,
To whom the heart was dedicated,
Isn't everything in Russian
Owning weakly and with difficulty,
It was so sweetly distorted,
And in their mouths the language is foreign
Have you turned to your native one?

God forbid I get together at the ball
Or when driving on the porch
With a seminarian in a yellow chalet
Or with an academician in a cap!
Like rosy lips without a smile,
Without a grammatical error
I don't like Russian speech.
Perhaps to my misfortune,
There are new generation of beauties,
Magazines heeding the pleading voice,
It will teach us grammar;
Poems will be put into use;
But what do I care?
I will be faithful to the old days.

Incorrect, careless babbling,
Inaccurate pronunciation of speeches
Still a heart flutter
They will produce it in my chest;
I have no strength to repent,
Gallicisms will be nice to me,
Like the sins of the past youth,
Like Bogdanovich's poems.
But enough is enough. It's time for me to get busy
By the letter of my beauty;
I gave my word, so what? By God
Now I'm ready to give up.
I know: Gentle Guys
The pen is not in fashion these days.

The singer of Feasts and languid sadness,
If you were still with me,
I would have made an immodest request.
To disturb you, my dear:
To the magic tunes
You shifted the passionate virgin
Foreign words.
Where are you? Come: your rights
I give it to you with a bow
But in the midst of sad rocks,
Weaning our hearts from praise,
Alone, under the Finnish sky,
He wanders, and his soul
He does not hear my grief.

Tatiana's letter is in front of me;
I cherish it sacredly,
I read with secret longing
And I can't read enough.
Who inspired her with this tenderness too,
And words of amiable negligence?
Who inspired her with tender nonsense,
Crazy heart talk,
And fascinating and harmful?
I can't understand. But here
Incomplete, weak translation,
From the tableau, the list is pale
Or a staged Freischitz
Through the fingers of timid students:
Tatiana's letter to Onegin
I'm writing to you, what's more?
What else can I say?
Now, I know, in your will
To punish me with contempt.
But you, to my unfortunate lot
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to be silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know,
When would I have had hope
At least rarely, at least once a week
To see you in our village,
Just to hear your speeches,
Say a word to you, and then
Keep thinking, thinking about one thing
And day and night until we meet again.
But they say you are unsociable;
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And we don't shine with anything,
Even though we are innocently glad to see you.
Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
I would never have known you,
I would not know the bitter torment.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
I would have found a friend according to my heart,
There would be a faithful spouse
And a virtuous mother.
The other one!.. No, no one in the world
I would not give my heart!
That in the Highest is destined to be the council
It is the will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life has been a pledge
Goodbye faithful to you;
I know you were sent to me by God.,
You are my guardian to the grave
You appeared to me in my dreams
Invisible, you were too sweet to me,
Your wonderful look tormented me,
Your voice sounded in my soul
Not for a long time, it wasn't a dream!
You came in a little bit, I found out in a moment,
She was all stunned and flushed
And in my mind I said: Here he is!
Isn't it true? I've heard you:
You spoke to me in silence,
When I helped the poor
Or she delighted me with prayer
The longing of a troubled soul?
And at this very moment
Isn't that you, sweet vision,
In the transparent darkness, he flashed,
Clung quietly to the headboard?
Not you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Or an insidious tempter:
Resolve my doubts.
Maybe it's all empty,
The deception of an inexperienced soul!
And it is destined to be completely different
But so be it! My fate
From now on, I'm handing you,
I'm crying in front of you,
For your protection, please
Imagine: I'm here alone,
No one understands me,
My mind is exhausted,
And I have to die in silence.
I'm waiting for you: with one eye
Revive the hopes of the heart
Or a heavy dream break,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
I'm coming! It's scary to reread
I freeze with shame and fear
But I'm on bail, Your Honor.,
And I boldly entrust myself to her

Tatiana will sigh, then gasp;
The letter trembles in her hand;
The pink wafer is drying
On an inflamed tongue.
She leaned her head to his shoulder,
The light shirt came down
From her lovely shoulder
But that's the moonbeam
The glow goes out. There's a valley there
It's getting clearer through the steam. There's a stream
Silvered; there's a horn
The shepherd wakes up the villager.
Here's the morning: everyone got up a long time ago,
My Tatiana doesn't care.

She does not notice the dawn,
She sits with a drooping head
And he doesn't press the letter
Its seal is cut-out.
But, quietly unlocking the door,
Oh, she's a gray-haired Filipyevna
He brings tea on a tray.
It's time, my child, get up:
Yes, you're ready, beautiful!
Oh, my early bird!
I was so afraid!
Yes, thank God, you're healthy!
There is no trace of night melancholy,
Your face is like the color of poppies.



But you see

So, let's go quietly grandson
With this note to O
To the neighbor and tell him to,
Don't let him say a word.,
So that he doesn't call me
To whom, my dear?
I've become clueless now.
There are a lot of neighbors around;
Where should I read them?


Dear friend, I'm too old,
She's old; her mind is getting dull, Tanya;
Otherwise, I used to be very,
Sometimes, the word of the lord's will
Oh, nanny, nanny! Before that?
What do I need in your mind?
You see, the case of the letter
To Onegin. Well, business, business.
Don't be angry, my soul,
You know, I'm not clear
Why are you turning pale again?
So, Nanny, it's really nothing.
Send your grandson.

But the day has passed, and there is no answer.
The other one has come: everything is not as it is not.
Pale as a shadow, dressed in the morning,
Tatiana is waiting: when is the answer?
Olga's admirer has arrived.

He had a question from the hostess.
He's completely forgotten us.
Tatiana flushed and trembled.

Lensky replied to the old woman,
Yes, it was obvious that the mail was delayed.
Tatiana lowered her gaze,
As if hearing an angry rebuke.

It was getting dark; on the table, shining,
The evening samovar hissed,
Chinese kettle heating;
A light steam was billowing under it.
Spilled by Olga's hand,
Through the cups with a dark stream
The fragrant tea was already running,
And the boy served cream;
Tatiana was standing in front of the window,
On the cold panes breathing,
Thinking, my soul,
She wrote with a lovely finger
On the foggy glass
The cherished monogram Oh yes e.

And yet her soul ached,
And the languid gaze was full of tears.
Suddenly there's a stomp!.. Her blood froze.
That's closer! They also jump into the yard
Eugene! And lighter than a shadow
Tatiana jumped into the other hall,
From the porch to the yard, and straight into the garden,
Flying, flying; take a look back
She doesn't dare; she ran around in a flash
Curtains, bridges, lawn,
The alley to the lake, the forest,
I broke the lilac bushes,
Flying through the flower beds to the stream.
And, panting, onto the bench

Fell
He's here! Eugene is here!
Oh my God! What did he think!
She has a heart full of torment,
Keeps the hopes of a dark dream;
She is trembling and bursting with heat,
And he waits: will it come? But he doesn't hear it.
In the maid's garden, on the ridges,
Picking berries in the bushes
And they sang in chorus according to the order
(A punishment based on,
So that the lord's berries are secretly
The evil mouth did not eat
And they were busy singing:
The idea of rural witticism!)
The song of the girls
Girls, beauties,
Dear friends, dear friends,
Play it out girls,
Take a walk, dear ones!
Tighten up the song,
A cherished song,
Lure the young man
To our round dance,
How to lure a good fellow,
As we see from afar,
Let's run away, dear ones,
Sprinkle with cherries,
Cherries, raspberries,
Red currant.
Don't go eavesdropping
Cherished songs,
Don't go peeping
Our games are girlish.

They sing, and, with carelessness
Listening to their sonorous voice,
Tatiana was waiting impatiently,
So that the flutter of her heart would subside,
To make the burning go away.
But there is the same trembling in the Persians,
And the fever does not go away.,
But brighter, brighter it just burns
That's how the poor moth shines
And it beats with a rainbow wing,
Captured by a schoolboy prankster;
So the bunny in the winter trembles,
Suddenly seeing from afar
Into the bushes of the fallen shooter.

But finally she sighed
And she got up from her bench;
I went, but I just turned around
Into the alley, right in front of her,
Shining eyes, Eugene
It stands like a menacing shadow,
And, as if burned by fire,
She stopped.
But the consequences of an unexpected meeting
Today, dear friends,
I can't retell it.;
I have to after a long speech
And take a walk and relax:
I'll finish it after sometime.


The less we love a woman,
The easier it is for her to like us
And the more likely we destroy it
In the midst of seductive networks.
Debauchery used to be cold-blooded
He was famous for his love life,
Trumpeting about himself everywhere
And enjoying without loving.
But this is important fun
Worthy of old monkeys
The vaunted grandfather's time:
Lovelace's dilapidated glory
With the glory of red heels
And stately wigs.

Who is not bored with hypocrisy,
It is different to repeat one thing,
It is important to try to assure that,
What has everyone been sure of for a long time,
All the same to hear objections,
Destroy preconceptions,
Which were not and are not
A girl at the age of thirteen!
Who won't get tired of threats,
Prayers, vows, imaginary fear,
Notes on six sheets,
Deceptions, gossip, rings, tears,
Supervision of aunts, mothers
And the friendship of hard husbands!

That's exactly what my Eugene thought.
He is in his first youth
He was a victim of violent delusions
And unbridled passions.
Spoiled by the habit of life,
I am temporarily fascinated by one,
Disappointed by the other,
We slowly languish in desire,
Languishing and windy success,
Listening in the noise and in the silence
Eternal murmuring of the soul,
Suppressing yawns with laughter:
That's how he killed eight years,
The loss of life is the best color.

He no longer fell in love with beauties,
Did you drag yourself around somehow;
They will refuse
Change was glad to have a rest.
He searched for them without enthusiasm,
And he left them without regret,
Barely remembering their love and anger.
That's right, an indifferent guest
He arrives at evening whist,
Sits down; the game is over:
He's leaving the yard,
He falls asleep quietly at home
And he doesn't know himself in the morning,
Where he's going in the evening.

But after receiving Tanya's message,
Onegin was vividly touched:
The language of girlish dreams
In it, the thoughts were outraged by a swarm;
And he remembered Tatiana Mila
And the color is pale and the appearance is dull;
And into a sweet, sinless sleep
He was immersed in his soul.
Perhaps the feeling is old-fashioned
He was possessed for a moment;
But he didn't want to cheat
The credulity of an innocent soul.
Now we're going to fly to the garden,
Where Tatiana met him.

They were silent for two minutes,
But Onegin came up to her
And he said: You wrote to me,
Don't deny it. I read it
The soul of a trusting confession,
Innocent outpouring of love;
I like your sincerity;
She made me nervous.
Long-silenced feelings;
But I don't want to praise you.;
I'll pay you back for it.
Recognition is also without art;
Accept my confession:
I'm giving myself up to you for judgment.

When would life be a domestic circle
I wanted to limit it;
When would I be a father, a spouse
A pleasant lot commanded;
When would it be a family picture
I was captivated at least for a moment.,
That's right, except for you alone
No one else was looking for a bride.
I will say without the madrigal sequins:
Having found my former ideal,
I probably would have chosen you alone.
As a friend of my sad days,
All the best as a pledge,
And I would be as happy as I could!

But I'm not made for bliss.;
My soul is alien to him;
Your perfections are in vain:
I am not worthy of them at all.
Believe me (conscience is a guarantee),
Marriage will be a torment to us.
No matter how much I love you,
Once I get used to it, I'll fall out of love immediately;
You will start crying: your tears
They will not touch my heart,
And they will only infuriate him.
Judge what kind of roses
Hymenaeus will prepare for us
And maybe for many days.

What could be worse in the world
Families with a poor wife
Sad about an unworthy husband,
Both in the afternoon and in the evening alone;
Where is the boring husband, knowing her value
(Fate, however, cursing),
Always frowning, silent,
Angry and coldly jealous!
That's me. And that's what they were looking for
You are a pure, fiery soul,
When with such simplicity,
Have you written to me with such intelligence?
Is this your lot
Appointed by a strict fate?

There is no return to dreams and years;
I will not renew my soul
I love you with the love of a brother
And maybe even more gently.
Listen to me without anger:
The younger maiden will replace me more than once
Dreams are easy dreams;
So the tree has its own leaves
It changes every spring.
So it is clearly destined by heaven.
You will love again: but
Learn to control yourself;
Not everyone will understand you like me.;
Inexperience leads to trouble.

That's how Eugene preached.
Through tears without seeing anything,
Barely breathing,
Tatiana listened to him without protest.
He held out his hand to her. Sadly
(As they say, mechanically)
Tatiana silently leaned on,
With a languid head bowing;
Let's go home around the garden;
They came together, and no one
I didn't try to blame them for that.
Rural freedom has
Your lucky rights,
So is arrogant Moscow.

You will agree, my reader,
Which is very nice.
With sad Tanya, our friend;
It's not the first time he's shown up here
Souls are direct nobility,
Although people are unwilling
Nothing was spared in him:
His enemies, his friends
(Which may be the same thing)
He was reviled this way and that.
Everyone in the world has enemies,
But God save us from our friends!
These are my friends, my friends!
I remembered them for a reason.

And what? Just like that. I'm putting you to sleep
Empty, black dreams;
I only notice in parentheses,
That there is no despicable slander,
In the attic, born a liar
And the secular rabble encouraged,
That there is no such nonsense,
No areal epigrams,
Which would be your friend with a smile,
In a circle of decent people,
Without any malice and tricks,
I didn't repeat it a hundred times by mistake;
However, he is a mountain for you:
He loves you so much like a native!

Hm! Hm! The reader is noble,
Is your whole family healthy?
Allow me: maybe you want to
Now you need to find out from me,
Which means exactly relatives.
Native people are like that:
We have to caress them,
To love, to respect mentally
And, according to the custom of the people,
About Christmas to visit them
Or send congratulations by mail,
So that the rest of the year
They didn't think about us.
So, God grant them long days!

But the love of gentle beauties
Is more reliable than friendship and kinship:
Above her and in the midst of rebellious storms
You retain your rights.
Of course it is. But the whirlwind of fashion,
But the waywardness of nature,
But the opinions of the secular stream
And the cute floor is light as a feather.
Besides, the opinions of the spouse
For a virtuous wife
They should always be honored;
So your faithful friend
Sometimes she is instantly carried away:
Satan is joking with love.

Who should I love? Who should I believe?
Who won't cheat on us alone?
Who measures all deeds, all speeches
Is it helpful for our yard?
Who is not spreading slander about us?
Who cares about us?
Who cares about our vice?
Who will never get bored?
The ghost is a vain seeker,
Labors in vain without ruining,
Love yourself,
My dear reader!
The subject is worthy: nothing
He's probably not nicer.

What was the consequence of the date?
Alas, it is not difficult to guess!
Love is crazy suffering
They didn 't stop worrying
A young soul, a greedy sorrow;
No, more than a joyless passion
Poor Tatiana is on fire;
Sleep is running in her bed;
Health, life color and sweetness,
Smile, virgin peace,
Everything is gone that the sound is empty,
And sweet Tanya's youth pales:
That's how the shadow dresses the storms
A barely born day.

Alas, Tatiana is fading,
It turns pale, goes out and is silent!
Nothing interests her,
She doesn't move her soul.
Shaking his head importantly,
The neighbors are whispering among themselves:
It's time, it's time for her to get married!..
But come on. I need to hurry up
To amuse the imagination
A picture of happy love.
Involuntarily, my dears,
I'm embarrassed by regret;
Forgive me: I love it so much
My dear Tatiana!

From hour to hour the captive is more
The beauties of Olga the young,
Vladimir sweet captivity
I gave myself up with a full soul.
He's always with her. In her peace
Two of them are sitting in the dark;
They are in the garden, hand in hand,
Walking in the morning;
And what about it? Intoxicated with love,
In the confusion of tender shame,
He only dares sometimes,
Olga's smile is encouraging,
Play with a developed curl
Or kiss the edge of your clothes.

He sometimes reads to Ole
A moral novel,
In which the author knows more
Nature than Chateaubriand,
Meanwhile, two, three pages
(Empty nonsense, tall tales,
Dangerous for the heart of virgins)
He skips, blushing.
Getting away from everyone far away,
They are above the chessboard,
Leaning on the table, sometimes
They sit deep in thought,
And Lensky pawns the rook
He takes his own in distraction.

Will he go home, and at home
He's busy with his Olga.
Flying album Sheets
Diligently decorates it:
Then in them he paints rural views,
A tombstone, the temple of Cypress,
Or a dove on the lyre
With a pen and paints slightly;
That's on the memory sheets
Lower than the signatures of others
He leaves a gentle verse,
A silent monument of dreaming,
A momentary thought, a long trail,
Still the same after many years.

Of course, you've seen it more than once
County young ladies album,
That all the girlfriends are dirty
From the end, from the beginning and all around.
Here, to spite the spelling,
Poems without measure, according to tradition
As a sign of friendship, the faithful have been introduced,
Reduced, continued.
On the first leaf you meet
Quecrrez-ous sur ces tabettes,
And the signature: T. A. Annette;
And on the last one you will read:
Who loves more than you,
Let him write further than me.

Here you will certainly find
Two hearts, a torch and flowers;
That's right, you'll read the vows
In love to the grave;
Some kind of army pete
Then a villainous rhyme came up.
In such an album, my friends,
I must admit, I am glad to write too,
I'm sure being a soul,
That all my zealous nonsense
He will earn a favorable look
And then what happens with an evil smile
It will not be important to disassemble,
Acutely or not, I could have lied.

But you, the disparate volumes
From the library of devils,
Great albums,
The torment of fashionable rhymers,
You, decorated nimbly
Tolstoy with a miraculous brush
Or Baratynsky's pen,
May God's thunder burn you!
When the brilliant lady
He gives me his n-quarto,
And trembling and anger takes me away,
And the epigram moves
In the depths of my soul,
And write them madrigals!

Lensky does not write madrigals
In Olga Molodoy's album;
His pen breathes love,
Does not coolly shine with sharpness;
Whatever he notices or hears
About Olga, he writes about
It: And, full of living truth,
Elegies flow like a river.
So you are inspired by Languages,
In the impulses of his heart,
Sing God knows who,
And the precious set of elegies
You don't have time to imagine
The whole story of your fate.

But hush! Do you hear? The critic is strict
Commands us to reset
Elegies are a miserable wreath,
And our rhyming brothers
Screaming: Yes, stop crying,
And it's all the same croaking,
Regretting the old, about the past:
Enough, sing about something else!
You're right, and you'll point us out correctly
A trumpet, a disguise and a dagger,
And thoughts are dead capital
You'll have to resurrect it from everywhere:
Isn't that right, friend? Not at all. Where to!
Write odes, gentlemen,

How they were written in the powerful years,
As it was in the old days
Some solemn odes!
And, come on, friend; does it really matter?
Remember what the satirist said!
The cunning lyricist
Is it more tolerable for you
Our sad rhymers?

Its empty purpose is pathetic;
Meanwhile, the goal of the ode is high
And it would be possible to be noble Here
We can argue, but I'm silent:
I don't want to quarrel for two centuries.

A fan of fame and freedom,
In the excitement of his stormy thoughts,
Vladimir would write odes,
Yes, Olga did not read them.
Have poets ever been tearful
Read into the eyes of your dear ones
Your creations? They say,
That there are no awards in the world above.
And right away, blessed is the humble lover
Who reads his dreams
The subject of songs and love,
The beauty is pleasantly languid!
Blessed though, maybe she is
I am entertained in a completely different way.

But I am the fruit of my dreams
And harmonic ideas
I only read to the old nurse.,
A friend of my youth,
Yes, after a boring lunch
A stray neighbor came to me,
Caught unexpectedly by the floor,
The soul is a tragedy in the corner,
Or (but this is no joke),
Longing and rhyming torment,
Wandering over my lake,
Scaring a herd of wild ducks:
Heeding the singing of mellifluous stanzas,
They fly off the coast.

And what about Onegin? By the way, brothers!
I ask for your patience:
His daily activities
I will describe it to you in detail.
Onegin lived an anchorite:
He got up at seven o'clock in the summer
And he went light
To the river running under the mountain;
Gulnara's singer imitating,
This Hellespont swam,
Then I drank my coffee,
Bad magazine going over,
And he was getting dressed

Walking, reading, deep sleep,
Forest shadow, the murmur of streams,
Sometimes white-eyed
A young and fresh kiss,
The bridle is an obedient and zealous horse,
Lunch is quite whimsical,
A bottle of light wine,
Solitude, silence:
This is Onegin's holy life;
And he's insensitive to her
Indulged in the red summer days
In careless bliss, not counting,
Forgetting the city, and friends,
And the boredom of festive undertakings.

But our northern summer,
A caricature of southern winters,
Will flash and not: it is known,
Although we don't want to admit it.
The sky was breathing in autumn,
The sun shone less often,
The day was getting shorter,
The mysterious canopy of forests
She was getting naked with a sad noise,
Fog lay on the fields,
A caravan of noisy geese
It stretched to the south: it was approaching
It's a pretty boring time;
It was already November at the yard.

The dawn rises in the cold darkness;
In the fields, the noise of work has stopped;
With his hungry wolf
A wolf comes out on the road;
Sensing him, the road horse
The careful traveler also snores
Rushing uphill at full speed;
At the dawn of the shepherd
He doesn't drive the cows out of the barn,
And at the noon hour in a circle
They are not called by his horn;
In the hut, singing, the maiden
Spinning, and, winter friend of the nights,
A splinter crackles in front of her.

And now the frosts are already cracking
And they are silvered in the middle of the fields
(The reader is waiting for the rhyme of the rose;
Here, take it quickly!)
Neater than a fashionable parquet
The river shines, it is clothed with ice.
Boys are a joyful people
Ice skates soundly cuts the ice;
The goose is heavy on red paws,
Having conceived the idea of sailing through the bosom of the waters,
Treads carefully on the ice,
Slides and falls; cheerful
The first snow is flickering, curling,
Stars falling on the breg.

In the wilderness, what to do at this time?
To walk? The village of that time
Unwittingly bothers the eye
Monotonous nudity.
To ride on horseback in the harsh steppe?
But a horse with a blunted horseshoe
The wrong one is hooking the ice,
And that's what you expect to fall.
Sit under a deserted roof,
Read: Here's Pradt, here's W. Scott.
Don't you want to? trust the expense,
Get angry or drink, and the evening is long
How will it go, and tomorrow also,
And you'll have a nice winter.

Direct Onegin Child-Harold
I fell into a thoughtful laziness:
He sits down in an ice bath from sleep,
And after that, at home all day,
Alone, immersed in calculations,
Armed with a blunt cue,
He's on a two-ball pool table
He's been playing since morning.
A rustic evening will come:
Billiards is abandoned, the cue is forgotten,
The table is set in front of the fireplace,
Evgeny is waiting: here comes Lensky
On three roan horses;
Let's have lunch soon!

The Widows of Clicquot or Moet
Blessed wine
In a frozen bottle for a poet
It was brought to the table immediately.
It sparkles and sparkles;
It is with its play and foam
(In the likeness of this)
I was captivated: for him

I used to give the last poor mite. Do you remember, friends?
His magic stream
She gave birth to a lot of nonsense,
And how many jokes and poems,
And arguments, and funny dreams!

But it changes with a noisy foam
It's in my stomach,
And I am a prudent Bordeaux
I've already chosen him over him.
I am no longer capable of Ai;
Au is like a lover
Shiny, windy, lively,
Both wayward and empty
But you, Bordeaux, are like a friend.,
Who, for better or for worse,
Comrade, always, everywhere,
Ready to do us a favor
Or quiet to share leisure time.
Long live Bordeaux, our friend!

The fire went out; barely with ashes
The golden coal is tinged;
A barely noticeable stream
Steam is spinning, and warmth
The fireplace is barely breathing. Smoke from pipes
It goes down the pipe. Light Cup
Still hissing in the middle of the table.
Evening finds the mist
(I love friendly lies
And a friendly glass of wine
Sometimes the one that is named
It's time between the wolf and the dog,
And why, I don't see.)
Now friends are talking:

Well, what about the neighbors? What is Tatiana?
Is Olga frisky yours?

That's enough, honey, the whole family
She is well; they told me to bow.
Oh, darling, how prettier you are
Olga has shoulders, what a chest!
What a soul! Someday
Let's go to them; you will oblige them;
Otherwise, my friend, you judge for yourself:
I looked in twice, and there
You can't even show your nose at them.
That's what a fool I am!
You're invited to them next week.

Yes, Tatiana's name day
On Saturday. Olenka and mother
They told me to call, and there is no reason
You don't have to come to the call.
But there will be a lot of people there
And all that kind of rabble
And, no one, I'm sure!
Who will be there? my own family.
Let's go, do me a favor!
Well, what about it?
At these words, he drained
A glass, an offering to a neighbor,
Then he started talking again
About Olga: such is love!

He was cheerful. Two weeks later
A happy deadline was set.
And the secret of the marriage bed,
And a wreath of sweet love
His raptures were expected.
Hymena worries, sorrows,
Yawns are cold stuff
He had never dreamed of it.
Meanwhile, we, the enemies of Hymen,
In home life, we see one
A series of tedious paintings,
A novel in the taste of La Fontaine
My poor Lensky, he
Was born for this life with his heart.

He was loved at least
That's what he thought, and he was happy.
Blessed is he a hundred times who is devoted to the faith,
Who, having calmed down a cold mind,
He rests in the bliss of the heart,
Like a drunken traveler at night,
Or, more gently, like a moth,
Into a spring sunken flower;
But the one who foresees everything is pathetic,
Whose head is not spinning,
Who are all the movements, all the words
In their translation, he hates,
Whose heart has been cooled by experience
And he forbade forgetting!


That year, the autumn weather
I stood in the yard for a long time,
Nature was waiting for winter.
Snow fell only in January
On the third in the night. Waking up early,
Tatiana saw through the window
In the morning, the whitewashed courtyard,
Curtains, roofs and fence,
There are light patterns on the glasses,
Trees in winter silver,
Forty merry people in the yard
And softly carpeted mountains
Winters are a resplendent carpet.
Everything is bright, everything is white all around.

Winter!.. The peasant, triumphant,
Updates the path on the firewood;
His horse, feeling the snow,
Trotting along somehow;
The reins are fluffy blowing up,
A dashing caravan is flying;
The driver is sitting on a bench
In a sheepskin coat, in a red sash.
Here's a yard boy running around,
Putting a bug in the sled,
Transforming yourself into a horse;
The minx has already frozen his finger:
He is both hurt and amused,
And his mother threatens him through the window

But maybe this kind of
Paintings will not attract you:
All this is low nature;
There is not much elegant here.
Warmed by inspiration from God,
Another poet with a luxurious style
He painted the first snow for us
And all the shades of winter bliss;
He will captivate you, I am sure of that,
Drawing in fiery verses
Secret sleigh rides;
But I'm not going to fight
Not with him yet, not with you,
The Finnish singer is young!

Tatiana (Russian soul,
I don't know why)
With her cold beauty
I loved the Russian winter,
In the sun and on a frosty day,
And the sleigh, and the dawn is late
The radiance of pink snow,
And the haze of Epiphany evenings.
In the old days, they triumphed
In their house these evenings:
Maids from all over the yard
They were guessing about their young ladies
And they were promised every year
Husbands of the military and the campaign.

Tatiana believed in the legends
The common people of antiquity,
And dreams, and card fortune-telling,
And the predictions of the moon.
She was worried about the signs;
All objects are mysterious to her
Did they proclaim anything,
Premonitions pressed against my chest.
A simpering cat sitting on the stove,
Purring, he washed his snout with his paw:
That was an unmistakable sign to her,
That the guests are coming. Suddenly seeing
The younger two-horned face of the moon
In the sky on the left side,

She was trembling and turning pale.
When is a shooting star
I was flying through the dark sky
And it crumbled, then
In her confusion, Tanya was in a hurry,
While the star was still rolling,
The desire of the heart to whisper to her.
When it happened somewhere
She should meet a black monk
Or a fast hare between the fields
I ran across her path,
Not knowing what to start with fear,
Full of sorrowful forebodings,
She was waiting for misfortune.

Well? I found a secret charm
And she's really terrified.:
This is how nature created us,
She is prone to counter-speech.
It's Christmas Eve. That's the joy!
The windy youth is guessing,
Which is not sorry for anything,
Before which life is far away
Lies bright, boundless;
Old age is guessing through glasses
At his coffin board,
Having lost everything irrevocably;
And still: hope for them
He lies with his childish babble.

Tatiana with a curious look
He looks at the sunken wax:
It's a wonderfully molded pattern
Something wonderful says to her;
From a dish full of water,
The rings come out in succession;
And a ring came out for her
To the song of the old days:
The peasants are all rich there,
They are rowing silver with a shovel;
To whom I sing, that's good
And glory! But it promises losses
This song is a pitiful tune;
A sweet little cat to the heart of virgins.

The night is frosty, the whole sky is clear;
Heavenly luminaries wondrous choir
It flows so quietly, so according to
Tatiana on the wide courtyard
She goes out in an open dress,
For a month, the mirror is pointing;
But there is one in the dark mirror
The sad moon is trembling
Chu virgo
Flying towards him on tiptoe,
And her voice sounds
More gentle than a pipe tune:
What's your name? He's watching
And he answers: Agathon.

Tatiana, on the advice of the nanny
Gathering at night to conjure,
Quietly ordered in the bathhouse
Set the table for two sets;
But suddenly Tatiana became afraid
And I'm thinking about Svetlana
I was scared.
We can't do magic with Tatiana.
Tatiana silk belt
I took it off, undressed and went to bed
She lay down. Lel is hovering over her,
And under the down pillow
The maiden's mirror is lying.
Everything has calmed down. Tatiana is sleeping.

And Tatiana has a wonderful dream.
She dreams that she is
Walking through a snow glade,
Surrounded by a sad haze;
In the snowdrifts in front of her
It makes noise, swirls with its own wave
Ebullient, dark and gray-haired
A stream that is not constrained in winter;
Two perches, glued together by an ice floe,
A trembling, disastrous bridge,
Put through the stream;
And before the roaring abyss,
Full of Perplexity,
She stopped.

Like an annoying separation,
Tatiana grumbles at the stream;
Does not see anyone who has a hand
From that side, I would have given it to her;
But suddenly the snowdrift began to move.
And who came out from under it?
A big, disheveled bear;
Tatiana ah! And he roars,
And a paw with sharp claws
He handed it to her; she braced herself
She leaned on her trembling hand
And with timid steps
I crossed the stream;
Went and what? The bear is after her!

She, not daring to look back,
Hurriedly accelerates her step;
But from a shaggy footman
He can't escape in any way;
Grunting, the obnoxious bear falls down;
The forest is before them; the pines are motionless
In its frowning glory;
Their branches are all burdened
Patches of snow; through the peaks
Aspens, birches and lime trees naked
The ray of the luminaries of the night shines;
There is no road; bushes, rapids
Everyone is covered in a snowstorm,
Buried deep in the snow.

Tatiana goes into the forest; the bear follows her;
The snow is loose up to her knees;
That long bough of hers by the neck
It will catch you suddenly, then out of your ears
Gold earrings will be torn out by force;
That's in the fragile snow with a cute foot
A wet shoe will get stuck;
Then she will drop the handkerchief;
She has no time to lift; she is afraid,
He hears the bear behind him,
And even with a trembling hand
The edge of the clothes is ashamed to raise;
She runs, he follows her,
And she has no strength to run anymore.

She fell into the snow; the bear was nimble
She is grabbed and carried;
She is insensitively submissive,
He won't move, he won't die;
He rushes her along the forest road;
Suddenly, there is a squalid hut between the trees;
It's all in the wilderness; he's everywhere
It is covered with desert snow,
And the window is shining brightly,
And there is shouting and noise in the hut;
The bear said: My godfather is here:
Warm up at his place a little!
And he goes straight into the hall
And he puts it on the doorstep.

When she came to her senses, Tatiana looked:
There was no bear; she was in the hall;
There is a scream and the clink of a glass outside the door,
Like at a big funeral;
Not seeing a bit of sense here,
She looks quietly through the crack,
And what does he see?.. at the table
Monsters are sitting all around:
One with horns and a dog's face,
The other one with a rooster's head,
There's a witch with a goatee here,
Here the skeleton is prim and proud,
There is a carla with a ponytail, but here
Half-crane and half-cattle.

Even scarier, even weirder:
Here's a cancer riding a spider,
Here is a skull on a goose neck
Spinning in a red hood,
Here the mill is dancing side by side
And it cracks and flaps its wings;
Barking, laughing, singing, whistling and clapping,
Human rumor and horse top!
But what did Tatiana think,
When I found out among the guests
Someone who is sweet and scary to her,
The hero of our novel!
Onegin is sitting at the table
And he looks furtively at the door.

He will give a sign
He drinks
He'll laugh.
He will furrow his brows
He's the boss there, that's clear:
And Tanya is not so terrible,
And, curious, now
I opened the door a little
Suddenly the wind blew, extinguishing
The fire of night lamps;
The gang of brownies was confused;
Onegin, his eyes sparkling,
He gets up from the table, rattling;
Everyone stood up: he was going to the door.

And she is afraid; and hurriedly
Tatiana tries to run:
It is impossible in any way; impatiently
Rushing, he wants to scream:
Eugene pushed the door open:
And a maiden
Appeared to the eyes of the hellish ghosts;
Fierce laughter rang wildly; the eyes of all,
Hooves, trunks are crooked,
Crested tails, fangs,
Mustache, bloody tongues,
Horns and fingers are made of bone,
Everything points to her,
And everyone is shouting: mine! Mine!

Mine! Yevgeny said menacingly,
And the whole gang suddenly disappeared;
I stayed in the frosty darkness
The younger virgo is with him himself-a friend;
Onegin is quietly captivating
Tatiana is in a corner and composes
Her on a rickety bench
And he bows his head
To her shoulder; suddenly Olga enters,
Lensky was behind her; the light flashed;
Onegin waved his hand,
And he wanders wildly with his eyes,
And scolds uninvited guests;
Tatiana is barely alive.

The argument is louder, louder; suddenly Eugene
Grabs a long knife, and in a moment
Lensky is defeated; the shadows are terrible thickened;
There was an unbearable scream
And Tanya woke up in horror
He looks, it's already light in the room;
In the window through the frozen glass
The crimson ray of dawn is playing;
The door opened. Olga to her,
Aurors of the northern Alay
And lighter than a swallow, it flies in;
Well, he says, you tell me,
Who did you see in your dream?

But she, the sisters, did not notice,
Lying in bed with a book,
Leaf by leaf sorting through,
And he doesn't say anything.
Although this book was not
No sweet fictions of the poet,
No wise truths, no paintings,
But neither Virgil nor Racine,
Neither Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneca,
Not even a Ladies Fashion Magazine
No one was so interested:
It was, friends, Martin Zadeka,
The head of the Chaldean sages,
A fortune teller, an interpreter of dreams.

This is a profound creation
Brought by a wandering merchant
One day to them in solitude
And finally for Tatiana
Its with a disparate
He conceded in three and a half minutes,
In addition, taking more for them
Collecting area fables,
Grammar, two Petriads
Yes, Marmontel's third volume.
Martin Zadeka became later
Tanya's favorite, He's a joy
In all her sorrows , he gives her
And he sleeps with her constantly.

She is disturbed by a dream.
Not knowing how to understand it,
Dreams have a terrible meaning
Tatiana wants to find it.
Tatiana in the short table of contents
Finds it in alphabetical order
Words: forest, storm, witch, spruce,
Hedgehog, darkness, bridge, bear, snowstorm
And other things. Her doubts
Martin Zadeka will not decide;
But a sinister dream promises her
There are many sad adventures.
For a few days she then
I was worried about that.

But with a crimson hand
Dawn from the morning valleys
It takes you out with the sun behind it
A merry birthday party.
In the morning, the Larins' house is visited
The whole house is full; whole families
The neighbors gathered in carts,
In caravans, in chaises and in sleighs.
There is a crush in the hall, an alarm;
There is a meeting of new faces in the living room,
The barking of the mosek, the smacking of the girls,
Noise, laughter, crush at the doorstep,
Bows, shuffling of guests,
Wet nurses cry and cry of children.

With his portly wife
A fat Trifle has arrived;
Gvozdin, the host is excellent,
The owner of the poor men;
Cattle, a gray-haired couple,
With children of all ages, counting
From thirty to two years old;
The county frenchman Petushkov,
My cousin's brother, Buyanov,
In fluff, in a cap with a visor
(As you are, of course, familiar with it),
And a retired adviser to Flyanov,
A heavy gossip, an old rascal,
A glutton, a bribe taker and a buffoon.

With the family of Panfil Harlikov
Monsieur Triquet also arrived,
A wit, recently from Tambov,
Wearing glasses and a red wig.
Like a true Frenchman, in your pocket
Trike brought a verse to Tatiana
To a voice known by children:
Reeez ous, bee endorme.
Between the old songs of the almanac
This verse was printed;
Trike, the shrewd poet,
He was born out of the dust,
And boldly instead of bee Nna
I put bee Tatana on.

And now from a nearby village
Mature young ladies idol,
County mothers are a joy,
The company commander arrived;
Oh, the news, but what!
The music will be regimental!
The colonel sent it himself.
What a joy: there will be a ball!
Girls jump ahead of time;
But the food was served. The couple
They go to the table hand in hand.
The young ladies are crowding towards Tatiana;
Men are against; and, crossing themselves,
The crowd buzzes, sitting down at the table.

The conversations stopped for a moment;
The mouth is chewing. From all sides
Plates and cutlery rattle
Yes, glasses are ringing.
But soon the guests gradually
A general alarm will be raised.
No one is listening, they are shouting,
They laugh, argue and squeak.
Suddenly the doors are wide open. Lensky enters,
And Onegin is with him.
The hostess shouts:
Guests are crowding, everyone is taking away
Appliances, chairs as soon as possible;
They call two friends and put them in jail.

They put him right in front of Tanya,
And, the morning moon is paler
And more trembling than a hunted deer,
She's a darkening eye
Does not lift: bursts violently
There is a passionate heat in her; she is stuffy, sick;
She greets two friends
He does not hear, tears from his eyes
They want to drip; they're ready
The poor thing is going to faint;
But will and reason are the power
They prevailed. She has two words
She said quietly through her teeth
And sat at the table.

Tragi-nervous phenomena,
Girlish fainting, tears
Eugene could not stand it for a long time:
He had suffered enough of them.
A weirdo, having got to a huge feast,
He was already angry. But the maid is languid
Noticing the trembling impulse,
Looking down in annoyance,
He sulked and, indignant,
He swore to infuriate Lensky
And certainly a lot of revenge.
Now, in advance, triumphant,
He began to draw in his soul
Caricatures of all the guests.

Of course, not only Eugene
I could see Tanya's confusion;
But the purpose of looks and judgments
At that time, the pie was fat
(Unfortunately, too salty);
Yes, in a salted bottle,
Between roast and blanc manger,
Tsimlyanskoe is already being carried;
Behind him is a line of narrow, long glasses,
Like your waist,
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
The subject of my innocent poems,
Love is a tempting violet,
You're the one I've been drunk on!

Getting rid of the wet cork,
The bottle popped; the wine
Hisses; and so with an important posture,
Tortured by the verse for a long time,
Trike stands up; the assembly is in front of him
He keeps a deep silence.
Tatiana is almost alive; Trike,
Turning to her with a piece of paper in his hand,
He sang out of tune. Splashes, clicks
He is welcomed. She
The singer is forced to sit down;
The poet is modest, though great,
Her health is the first to drink
And he passes the verse to her.

Send greetings, congratulations;
Tatiana thanks everyone.
When it comes to Eugenia
Got it, then the maidens look languid,
Her embarrassment, her tiredness
Pity was born in his soul:
He bowed to her in silence,
But somehow the gaze of his eyes
He was wonderfully gentle. Is that why,
That he was really touched,
Or was he flirting, playing pranks,
Involuntarily, or out of good will,
But this gaze expressed tenderness:
He revived Tanya's heart.

Chairs rattle as they are pushed back;
The crowd is pouring into the living room:
So bees from a delicious hive
A noisy swarm is flying to the field.
Happy with the festive lunch,
The neighbor sniffs in front of the neighbor;
The ladies sat down by the fireplace;
The girls are whispering in the corner;
The green tables are open:
The name of the fervent players
Boston and the Old Men's Pawnshop,
And whist, hitherto famous,
A monotonous family,
All sons of greedy boredom.

Eight Roberts have already played
Heroes of Whist; eight times
They were changing places;
And they're bringing tea. I love the hour
With lunch, tea
And dinner. We know the time
In a village without big vanities:
The stomach
And by the way, I'll note in parentheses,
What am I talking about in my stanzas
I talk about feasts just as often,
About different dishes and traffic jams,
How are you, divine Omir,
You, the idol of thirty centuries!

But tea is being brought; the girls are decorous
They barely took up the saucers,
Suddenly, from behind the door in the long hall
The bassoon and flute rang out.
Delighted by the thunder of music,
Leaving a cup of tea with rum,
Paris county towns,
He approaches Olga Petushkov,
To Tatiana Lensky; Harlikov,
The bride of the ripe years,
My poet takes Tambov,
Buyanov drove away to Pustyakova,
And everyone poured out into the hall.
And the ball shines in all its glory.

At the beginning of my novel
(See the first notebook)
I wanted to like Alban
Describe the St. Petersburg Ball;
But, amused by an empty dream,
I started remembering
About the legs of ladies I know.
In your narrow footsteps,
Oh legs, it's full of mistakes!
With the betrayal of my youth
It's time for me to become smarter,
To get better in business and in style,
And this fifth notebook
To clean from deviations.

Monotonous and insane,
Like the whirlwind of a young life,
The waltz is spinning, a noisy whirlwind;
The couple flashes by the couple.
Approaching the moment of vengeance,
Onegin, secretly grinning,
He approaches Olga. Quickly with her
Hanging around the guests,
Then he puts her on a chair,
He starts talking about this and that;
Two minutes later, then
He continues the waltz with her again;
Everyone is amazed. Lensky himself
He doesn't believe his own eyes.

The Mazurka was heard. It happened,
When the Mazurka thunder thundered,
Everything was shaking in the huge hall,
The parquet cracked under his heel,
The frames were shaking and rattling;
Now it's not that: and we, as ladies,
We slide along the lacquer boards.
But in the cities, in the villages
I also saved the Mazurka
The initial beauties:
Jumps, heels, mustache
All the same: I haven't changed them
Dashing fashion, our tyrant,
The disease of the newest Russians.

Buyanov, my perky brother,
He brought us to our hero
Tatiana and Olga; quickly
Onegin went with Olga;
He leads her, gliding casually,
And, bending down, he whispers softly to her
Some kind of vulgar madrigal,
And he shakes his hand and burns
In her proud face
The blush is brighter. Lensky is mine
I saw everything: I flared up, I'm not myself;
In jealous indignation
The poet is waiting for the end of the Mazurka
And he's calling her to the cotillion.

But she can't. Can't you? But what?
Yes, Olga has already given her word
Onegin. Oh, my God, my God!
What does he hear? She could
Is it possible? Just a little out of diapers,
A flirt, a flighty child!
She knows the trick,
She's already learned how to change!
Lensky is unable to bear the blow;
Women's leprosy swearing,
It turns out that he demands a horse
And he jumps. A couple of pistols,
Two bullets
Suddenly his fate will be resolved.


Noticing that Vladimir had disappeared,
Onegin, we are being driven by boredom again,
Near Olga, he plunged into the duma,
Pleased with his revenge.
Olenka yawned behind him,
I was looking for Lensky with my eyes,
And the endless cotillion
It tormented her like a heavy dream.
But it's over. They're coming for dinner.
Beds are made; for guests
The overnight stay is taken away from the entrance hall
Right up to the girlish. Everyone needs it
A peaceful dream. Onegin is mine
One went home to sleep.

Everything calmed down: in the living room
Snoring is a heavy trifle
With his heavy half.
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov
And Flyanov, not quite healthy,
They lay down on chairs in the dining room,
And on the floor is Monsieur Triquet,
In a sweatshirt, in an old hat.
The girls in Tatiana's rooms
And Olga is all wrapped up in sleep.
Alone, sad under the window
Illuminated by Diana's ray,
Poor Tatiana is not sleeping
And he looks into the dark field.

His unexpected appearance,
The instant tenderness of the eyes
And strange behavior with Olga
To the depths of his soul
She's penetrated; she can't
I can't understand him; it bothers me
Her jealous longing,
It's like a cold hand
Her heart feels tight, like an abyss
It's black and noisy under it

But death from him is kind.
I don't grumble: why grumble?
He can't give me happiness.

Go ahead, go ahead, my story!
A new face is calling us.
Five versts from Krasnogorie,
The village of Lensky, lives
And long live to this day
In the philosophical desert
Zaretsky, once a brawler,
The chieftain of the card gang,
The head of the rakes, the tribune of the tavern,
Now it's kind and simple
The father of the family is single,
A reliable friend, a peaceful landowner
And even an honest man:
This is how our century is being corrected!

Sometimes, the flattering voice of light
He showed off his evil bravery:
He really hit the ace with a pistol
I got into five fathoms,
And I can say that I got into a battle
Once in a real rapture
He distinguished himself, bravely in the mud
Falling off the Kalmyk horse,
Like a drunk, and the French
I was captured: a dredge pledge!
The newest Regulus, the god of honor,
Ready to relive the bond,
To have Faith every morning
There are three bottles on loan to drain.

He used to sound funny.,
He knew how to fool a fool
And it's nice to fool a smart one,
Either explicitly, or surreptitiously,
Although he has other things
We did not pass without science,
Although sometimes I'm in a mess myself
He was caught like a simpleton.
He could argue cheerfully,
To answer sharply and stupidly,
Sometimes it is prudent to keep silent,
Sometimes it 's prudent to quarrel,
Friends to quarrel with the young
And put them on the barrier,

Or to make them reconcile
In order to have breakfast with the three of them,
And then secretly dishonor
A funny joke, a lie.
Sed aa tempora! Audacity
(Like a love dream, another prank)
Passes with youth alive.
As I said, my Zaretsky,
Under the canopy of cherry trees and acacias
Hiding from the storms at last,
He lives like a true sage,
He plants cabbage like Horace,
Breeds ducks and geese
And teaches the alphabet to children.

He was not stupid; and my Eugene,
Not respecting the heart in him,
I also loved the spirit of his judgments,
And common sense about this and that.
He used to enjoy it.,
I've seen him, and I haven't seen him at all
I wasn't surprised in the morning,
When he saw it.
The one after the first greeting,
Interrupting the conversation that started,
Onegin, grinning,
He handed me a note from the poet.
Onegin went to the window
And I read it to myself.

It was a pleasant, noble one,
A short call, or a cartel:
Courteously, with cold clarity
Lensky called his friend to a duel.
Onegin from the first movement,
To the ambassador of such an assignment
Turning around, without unnecessary words
He said he was always ready.
Zaretsky stood up without explanation;
I didn't want to stay in the share,
Having many things to do at home,
He immediately went out; but Eugene
Alone with your soul
I was dissatisfied with myself.

And it serves you right: in a strict analysis,
Calling himself to a secret court,
He blamed himself for a lot of things:
First of all, he was already wrong,
What is above a timid, gentle love
That's how Vechor casually joked.
And secondly: let the poet
Fooling around; at the age of eighteen
It's excusable. Evgeniy,
Loving the young man with all my heart,
I had to prove myself
Not a ball of speculation,
Not an ardent boy, a fighter,
But a husband with honor and intelligence.

He could have discovered the feelings,
Instead of bristling like an animal;
He was supposed to disarm
A young heart. But now
It's too late; time has flown away
Besides, this is the case
The old duelist intervened;
He's angry, he's a gossip, he's a talker
Of course, there must be contempt
At the cost of his funny words,
But the whispers, the laughter of fools
And here is the public opinion!
The spring of honor, our idol!
And that's what the world is spinning on!

Seething with impatient hostility,
The poet is waiting for an answer at home;
And now the neighbor is grandiose
I brought the answer solemnly.
Now it's a holiday for the jealous one!
He was always afraid that the prankster
Didn't laugh it off somehow,
Having invented a trick and a breast
Turning away from the gun.
Now the doubts are solved:
They have to go to the mill
Arrive tomorrow before dawn,
Pull the trigger on each other
And aim at the thigh or the temple.

Deciding to hate a flirt,
Boiling Lensky did not want to
To see Olga before the fight,
I looked at the sun, at the clock,
He waved his hand one last time
And I ended up with the neighbors.
He thought to embarrass Olenka,
To impress with your arrival;
It was not there: as before,
To meet the poor singer
Olenka jumped off the porch,
It is like a windy hope,
Frisky, carefree, cheerful,
Well, exactly the same as it was.

That was Olenka's first question.
All the feelings in Lensky were confused,
And he hung his nose in silence.
Jealousy and annoyance disappeared
Before this clarity of view,
Before this gentle simplicity,
Before this frisky soul!..
He looks at me with sweet emotion;
He sees that he is still loved;
He is already tormented by remorse,
Ready to ask her forgiveness,
Trembling, unable to find words,
He's happy, he's almost healthy.

And again thoughtful, sad
Before my dear Olga,
Vladimir has no power
Yesterday to remind her;
He thinks: I will be her savior.
I will not tolerate a corrupter
With fire and sighs and praises
Tempted the younger heart;
So that the worm is despicable, poisonous
Sharpened the lily stalk;
To have a two-morning flower
Withered still half-open.
It all meant, friends:
I'm shooting with a friend.

If only he knew what kind of wound it was
My Tatiana's heart was burning!
When would Tatiana have known,
When would she have known,
What's tomorrow Lensky and Evgeny
They will argue about the grave canopy;
Ah, maybe her love
I would connect my friends again!
But this passion is also accidental
No one has opened it yet.
Onegin was silent about everything;
Tatiana languished secretly;
Only a nanny would know,
Yes, she was stupid.

Lensky was distracted all evening,
Now silent, now cheerful again;
But the one who is cherished by the muse,
Always like this: frowning brow,
He sat down at the harpsichord
And he played only chords on them,
That is, with eyes fixed on Olga,
Whispered: Isn't it true? I'm happy.
But it's too late; it's time to go. It shrank
He has a heart full of longing;
Saying goodbye to the young virgin,
It felt like it was bursting.
She looks at his face.
And onto the porch.

Having arrived home, pistols
He examined it, then put it in
Put them back in the drawer and undressed,
By candlelight, Schiller opened;
But one thought surrounds him;
A sad heart does not sleep in him:
With an inexplicable beauty
He sees Olga in front of him.
Vladimir closes the book,
He takes a pen; his poems,
Full of love nonsense,
They sound and flow. He reads them
He's out loud, in lyrical heat,
Like Delvig drunk at a feast.

Poems have been preserved in case;
I have them; here they are:
Where, where have you gone,
Are my golden days of spring?
What does the coming day have in store for me?
My gaze catches him in vain,
He lurks in the deep darkness.
There is no need; the law of fate is right.
Will I fall, pierced by an arrow,
Or it will fly by,
All good things: vigils and sleep
The hour is coming.;
Blessed is the day of worries,
Blessed is the coming of darkness!

The day's ray will flash in the morning
And a bright day will begin to play;
And I, perhaps, am the tomb
I'll go down into the mysterious canopy,
And the memory of the young poet
The slow Summer will swallow you up,
The world will forget me; but you
Will you come, virgin of beauty,
To shed a tear over an early urn
And to think: he loved me,
He dedicated one to me
The sad dawn of a stormy life!..
A warm friend, a welcome friend,
Come, come: I am your husband!..

So he wrote darkly and listlessly
(What do we call romanticism,
At least there is no romanticism here
I don't see; but what's in it for us?)
And finally before dawn,
Bowing his tired head,
On the buzzword ideal
Lensky dozed off quietly;
But only with a sleepy charm
He forgot himself, the neighbor
An office enters the silent one
And he wakes up Lensky with an appeal:
It's time to get up: it's past seven.
Onegin is surely waiting for us.

But he was wrong: Eugene
I was sleeping like a dead man at that time.
The night shadows are already thinning
And met by Vesper the rooster;
Onegin sleeps deeply for himself.
The sun is already rolling high,
And a migratory snowstorm
It glitters and curls; but the bed
Eugene hasn't left yet,
There is also a dream flying over him.
He finally woke up
And the curtain parted the floors;
He looks and sees that it's time
It's been a long time since we left the yard.

He's calling as soon as possible. Runs in
A French servant,
Guillot, offers him a robe and shoes
And she hands him the laundry.
Onegin is in a hurry to get dressed,
He tells the servant to get ready
Go with him and with yourself
Take also the combat box.
The cross-country sled is ready.
He sat down, he's flying to the mill.
They rushed over. He tells the servant to
Lepage's trunks are fatal
Carry him, and the horses
Drive off into the field to the two oaks.

Leaning on the dam, Lensky
I've been waiting impatiently for a long time;
Meanwhile, the mechanic is rustic,
Zaretsky condemned the millstone.
Onegin comes with an apology.
He said with amazement
Zaretsky,
In duels, the classic and the pedant,
He loved the method out of feeling,
And stretch the man
He didn't allow it somehow,
But in the strict rules of art,
According to all the traditions of antiquity
(What should we praise in it).


Here it is: my friend, monseur Guot.
I don't anticipate any objections.
To my performance:
Although he is an unknown person,
But he's certainly an honest guy.
Zaretsky bit his lip.
Onegin asked Lensky:

Vladimir said. And let's go
For the mill. While away
Our Zaretsky is an honest fellow
We have entered into an important agreement,
The enemies stand with downcast eyes.

Enemies! How long have we been apart
Did their bloodlust take them away?
Have they been leisure hours for a long time,
A meal, thoughts and deeds
Shared it amicably? Now it is malicious,
Hereditary enemies are like,
Like in a terrible, incomprehensible dream,
They are each other in silence
They prepare death in cold blood
Don't laugh at them until
Their hand was not stained,
Should we break up amicably?..
But a wildly secular feud
Afraid of false shame.

The pistols have already flashed,
The hammer rattles on the ramrod.
Bullets go into the faceted barrel,
And the trigger clicked for the first time.
Here's the gunpowder in a grayish trickle
It's spilling onto the shelf. Toothed,
Securely screwed flint
It's still cocked. For the near stump
Guillot becomes confused.
Cloaks are thrown by two enemies.
Zaretsky thirty-two steps
I measured it with excellent accuracy,
I spread my friends on the extreme trail,
And everyone took their own gun.


In cold blood,
Not yet aiming, two enemies
With a firm, quiet, even gait
Four steps crossed,
The four mortal stages.
Your gun then Eugene,
Without ceasing to advance,
He began to raise the first one quietly.
Here are five more steps,
And Lensky, squinting his left eye,
He also began to aim , but just
Onegin fired a shot
The clock is fixed: the poet
He drops the gun in silence,

He puts his hand gently on his chest
And falls. Misty eyes
It depicts death, not agony.
So slowly down the slope of the mountains,
Sparkling in the sun,
A block of snow is falling.
Instantly doused with cold,
Onegin is in a hurry to see the young man,
He looks, he calls him in vain:
He is no longer there. The younger singer
I found an untimely end!
The storm blew, the color is beautiful
Withered at the dawn,
The fire on the altar has gone out!..

He lay motionless, and strange
There was a languid world of his brow.
He was shot through the chest;
Blood flowed steaming from the wound.
One moment ago
Inspiration was beating in this heart,
Enmity, hope and love,
Life was playing, blood was boiling,
Now it's like an empty house,
Everything in it is both quiet and dark;
It has been silenced forever.
Shutters are closed, windows are chalked
Whitewashed. There is no hostess.
And where, God knows. The trace was gone.

A pleasantly cheeky epigram
Infuriate a misguided enemy;
It's nice to see how stubborn he is
Bowing their cheerful horns,
Involuntarily he looks in the mirror
And he's ashamed to recognize himself;
It's nicer if he's friends,
Howling foolishly: it's me!
It is even more pleasant to be silent
He needs to prepare an honest coffin
And quietly aim at the pale forehead
At a noble distance;
But to send him to his fathers
It will hardly be pleasant for you.

Well, if your gun
Smitten by a young friend,
An immodest look, or an answer,
Or some other trifle
The one who insulted you behind the bottle,
Or even himself in a passionate annoyance
Who proudly challenged you to battle,
Tell me: with your soul
What feeling will take over,
When we are motionless, on the ground
Before you with death on your forehead,
He's gradually stiffening up,
When he is deaf and silent
To your desperate appeal?

In the anguish of heartfelt remorse,
Clutching the gun with his hand,
Eugene looks at Lensky.
The neighbor decided.
Killed!.. With this terrible exclamation
Smitten, Onegin shudders
He goes away and calls people.
Zaretsky carefully puts
There's an icy corpse on the sleigh;
He's bringing a terrible treasure home.
Sensing the dead, they snore
And the horses are fighting, white foam
Steel wet bits,
And they flew like an arrow.

My friends, you feel sorry for the poet:
In the color of joyful hopes,
They have not yet been accomplished for the light,
A little bit of baby clothes,
Withered! Where is the hot excitement,
Where is the noble aspiration
And the feelings and thoughts of the young,
Tall, gentle, daring?
Where are the stormy desires of love,
And the thirst for knowledge and work,
And the fear of vice and shame,
And you, cherished dreams,
You, the ghost of an unearthly life,
You holy poetry dreams!

Maybe he's for the good of the world.
Or at least he was born for fame;
His silent lyre
A rattling, continuous ringing
She could have raised it for centuries. The poet,
Perhaps on the steps of light
A high step was waiting.
His suffering shadow,
Perhaps she took it with her
A holy mystery, and for us
The life-giving voice has died,
And beyond the grave
The anthem of the times does not come to her,
The blessing of the tribes.

Or maybe even that: the poet
The ordinary one was waiting for fate.
The youth of the summer would have passed:
In him, the ardor of the soul would have cooled.
In many ways, he would have changed,
Parted with the muses, got married,
In the village, happy and horny,
I would wear a quilted robe;
Would you really know life,
Had gout at the age of forty,
Drank, ate, was bored, got fat, got sick,
And finally in my bed
B died in the midst of children,
Whiny women and doctors.

But whatever it is, the reader,
Alas, the lover is young,
A poet, a thoughtful dreamer,
Killed by a friendly hand!
There is a place: to the left of the village,
Where did the inspiration pet live,
Two pine trees have grown together by their roots;
Trickles writhed beneath them
Streams of the neighboring valley.
The ploughman likes to rest there,
And plunge the reapers into the waves
Ringing pitchers are coming;
There's a thick one by the stream in the shade
A simple monument has been erected.

Under it (as it starts to drip
Spring rain on the grain fields)
The shepherd, weaving his mottled lapot,
He sings about the Volga fishermen;
And the townswoman is young,
Spending the summer in the village,
When she's riding headlong she
Rushing through the fields alone,
He stops the horse in front of him, pulling
On the leash,
And, Fleur turned away from the hat,
He reads with his eyes
A simple inscription and a tear
It clouds the delicate eyes.

And he walks in an open field,
Plunging into dreams, she;
The soul is in it for a long time involuntarily
The fate of Lensky is full;
And he thinks: Has something happened to Olga?
Did her heart suffer for a long time,
Or is it time for tears soon?
And where is her sister now?
And where is the fugitive of people and light,
Fashionable beauties are a fashionable enemy,
Where is this cloudy weirdo,
The murderer of the young poet?
I will eventually report to you
I will give you details about everything,

But not now. Even though I'm cordially
I love my hero,
At least I'll go back to him, of course,
But I have no time for him now.
Summers tend to be harsh prose,
Let's chase the naughty rhyme,
And I'm following her lazily.
There is no ancient hunting in Peru
Dirty the flying sheets;
Other, cold dreams,
Other, strict concerns
And in the noise of the light and in the silence
They disturb the sleep of my soul.

I have known the voice of other desires,
I have known a new sadness;
I have no hopes for the former,
But I am sorry for the old sadness.
Dreams, dreams! Where is your sweetness?
Where is the eternal rhyme to her youth?
Is it really finally
Has her crown withered, withered?
Is it really straight and true
Without elegiac ideas
The spring of my days rushed by
(What have I been jokingly saying up to now)?
And is there really no return for her?
Am I going to be thirty soon?

So, my noon has come, and I need to
I have to admit it, I see.
But so be it: let's say goodbye amicably,
Oh, my easy youth!
Thank you for the pleasure,
For the sadness, for the sweet torment,
For the noise, for the storms, for the feasts,
For everything, for all your gifts;
Thank you. By you,
Amid worries and in silence,
I enjoyed it
That's enough! With a clear soul
I am now embarking on a new path
Take a break from the past life.

Let me look around. Excuse me, seni,
Where my days flowed in the wilderness,
Filled with passion and laziness
And the dreams of a thoughtful soul.
And you, the younger inspiration,
Excite my imagination,
Revive the slumber of the heart,
Come to my corner more often,
Don't let the poet's soul cool down,
To harden, to harden,
And finally petrify
In the deadening rapture of light,
In this pool, where am I with you
I'm swimming, dear friends!


Driven by the external rays,
There is already snow from the surrounding mountains
They escaped in muddy streams
To the sunken meadows.
Nature with a clear smile
Meets the morning of the year through a dream;
The skies are shining blue.
Still transparent, forests
It's like they're turning green.
The bee behind the tribute field
It flies from the wax cell.
The valleys dry up and are full of color;
The herds are noisy, and the nightingale
He sang in the silence of the nights.

How sad is your appearance to me,
Spring, spring! It's time for love!
What a languid excitement
In my soul, in my blood!
With what heavy emotion
I'm enjoying the breeze
In the face of the blowing spring
In the bosom of rural silence!
Or is pleasure alien to me,
And everything that pleases, lives,
Everything that rejoices and glitters
Boredom and longing
On a dead soul for a long time
And everything seems dark to her?

Or, not happy about the return
The sheets that died in the fall,
We remember the bitter loss,
Listening to the new noise of the forests;
Or with a lively nature
We bring the confused duma closer
We are the fading of our years,
Who has no rebirth?
Perhaps it occurs to us
In the midst of a poetic dream
A different, old spring
And the heart makes us tremble
The dream of the other side,
About a wonderful night, about the moon

Here's the time: good sloths,
Epicureans are wise men,
You, the indifferent lucky ones,
You, Levshin's school chicks,
You village Priams,
And you sensitive ladies,
Spring is calling you to the village,
It's time for warmth, flowers, and work,
It's time for the festivities of inspired
And seductive nights.
Into the fields, friends! Hurry up, hurry up,
In carriages heavily loaded,
For long or by post,
Stretch out from the outposts of the city.

And you, the benevolent reader,
In his wheelchair, discharged
Leave the restless hail,
Where did you have fun in winter;
With my wayward muse
Let's go listen to the oakwood noise
Above the nameless river
In the village where Eugene is mine,
The hermit is idle and sad,
Until recently, I lived in winter
Tanya is young in the neighborhood,
My sweet dreamer,
But where is he now?
Where sad he left a mark.

Between the mountains lying in a semicircle,
Let's go to where the stream is,
Twisting, he runs through a green meadow
To the river through the lime forest.
There's a nightingale, a lover of spring,
He sings all night; the rosehip blooms,
And the key dialect is heard,
The coffin stone is visible there
In the shade of two outdated pines.
The inscription says to the alien:
Vladimir Lensky lies here,
Who died early by the death of the brave,
In such a year, such a year.
Rest in peace, young poet!

On the branches of a bowed pine tree,
There used to be an early breeze
Above this humble urn
He was rocking a mysterious wreath.
Sometimes, in late leisure
Two friends came here,
And on the grave in the moonlight,
Hugging each other, they cried.
But now the monument is sad
Forgotten. There is a familiar trail to it
It stalled. There is no wreath on the branch;
One, underneath, is gray-haired and frail
The shepherd is still singing
And he weaves poor shoes.

My poor Lensky! languishing,
She didn't cry for long.
Alas! the bride is young
She is unfaithful to her sadness.
The other attracted her attention,
The other managed her suffering
To put to sleep with love flattery,
Ulan knew how to captivate her,
Ulan is loved by her soul
And now with him before the altar
She is shamefacedly under the crown
He stands with his head bowed,
With fire in downcast eyes,
With a light smile on his lips.

My poor Lensky! Beyond the grave
Within the limits of eternity deaf
Was he embarrassed, the singer is sad,
Treason by the fatal news,
Or over the Summer euthanized
The poet, blessed with insensibility,
He's not embarrassed by anything,
And the world is closed to him and mute?..
So! indifferent oblivion
Waiting for us behind the coffin.
Enemies, friends, mistresses voice
Suddenly it stops. About one name
The Heirs are an angry chorus
Starts an obscene argument.

And soon Olya's ringing voice
The Larin family fell silent.
Ulan, his slave share,
He had to go with her to the regiment.
Weeping bitterly,
An old woman saying goodbye to her daughter,
It seemed that she was almost alive,
But Tanya couldn't cry;
It was only covered with a mortal pallor
Her sad face.
When everyone came out on the porch,
And everything, saying goodbye, was bustling
Around the carriage of the young,
Tatiana saw them off.

And for a long time, as if through a fog,
She watched them go
And here is one, one Tatiana!
Alas! a friend of so many years,
Her dove is young,
Her confidante is dear,
Fate has brought her into the distance,
I am forever separated from her.
Like a shadow, she wanders aimlessly,
He looks at the empty garden
There is no joy for her anywhere, in anything,
And he finds no relief
She suppressed tears,
And my heart breaks in half.

And in the cruel solitude
Her passion burns stronger,
And about Onegin the distant
Her heart speaks louder.
She won't see him.;
She must hate him.
The murderer of his brother;
The poet died, but his
No one remembers, much less
His fiancee gave herself up.
The poet's memory flashed by
Like smoke across the blue sky,
There are two hearts about him, maybe,
Still sad, why be sad?..

It was evening. The sky was fading. Water
They flowed quietly. The beetle was buzzing.
The dances were already breaking up;
It was already burning, smoking, across the river
Fishing fire. In a clean field,
The moon in the silver light,
Immersed in her dreams,
Tatiana walked alone for a long time.
Walking, walking. And suddenly in front of him
From the hill, the lord sees a house,
A village, a grove under the hill
And a garden over a bright river.
She looks and the heart is in her
It began to beat more often and more strongly.

Her doubts are confusing:
Will I go forward, will I go back?..
He's not here. They don't know me
I'll take a look at the house, at this garden.
And so Tatiana comes down the hill,
Barely breathing; she circles around
Full of perplexity
And he enters the deserted courtyard.
Dogs rushed towards her, barking.
At the cry of her frightened
Children, the yard family
She came running noisily. Not without a fight
The boys dispersed the dogs,
Taking the young lady under his protection.

Tanya asked. Hurry up
The children ran to Anisya
Take the keys from her hall;
Anisya came to her at once,
And the door opened in front of them,
And Tanya enters the house empty,
Where our hero lived recently.
She looks: forgotten in the hall
The cue was resting on the billiard table,
He was lying on a crumpled sofa
A riding crop. Tanya dahle;
The old lady to her:
Here the gentleman sat alone.

I had lunch with him here in the winter
The late Lensky, our neighbor.
Come here, follow me.
This is the master's office;
He slept here, ate coffee,
I listened to the clerk's reports
And I read a book in the morning
And the old gentleman lived here;
With me, it used to be on Sunday,
Here under the window, wearing glasses,
He was playing the fool.
God grant his soul salvation,
And his bones are at peace
In the grave, in the damp mother earth!

Tatiana with a tender look
He looks at everything around him,
And everything seems priceless to her,
Everything gives life to a languid soul
A semi- painful joy:
And a table with a dimmed lamp,
And a pile of books, and under the window
The bed is covered with carpet,
And the view out the window through the moonlight twilight,
And this pale half-light,
And Lord Byron's portrait,
And a column with a cast-iron doll
Under a hat with a cloudy brow,
With hands clasped in a cross.

Tatiana has been in the fashionable cell for a long time
How charmed she is.
But it's too late. The wind got cold.
It's dark in the valley. The grove is sleeping
Above the misty river;
The moon has disappeared behind the mountain,
And a young pilgrim
It's time, it's time to go home.
And Tanya, hiding her excitement,
Not without sighing,
He starts on his way back.
But first he asks for permission
To visit a deserted castle,
To read books here alone.

Tatiana said goodbye to the housekeeper
Outside the gate. Every other day
She came back early in the morning
She's in the abandoned canopy.
And in a silent office,
Forgetting everything for a while,
I'm finally alone,
And she cried for a long time.
Then I started reading books.
At first she had no time for them,
But their choice seemed to be
It's strange to her. I have devoted myself to honor
Tatiana is a greedy soul;
And another world opened up to her.

Although we know that Eugene
I've stopped loving reading for a long time,
However, there are several creations
He excluded from the disgrace:
Singer Giaur and Juan
Yes, there are two or three more novels with him,
Which reflected the century
And the modern man
It is depicted quite correctly
With his immoral soul,
Selfish and dry,
Devoted to Dreams immensely,
With his embittered mind,
Boiling in empty action.

We kept many pages
A sharp nail mark;
The eyes of an attentive girl
They are focused on them more vividly.
Tatiana sees with trepidation,
What a thought, a remark
Onegin was amazed,
Which he silently agreed to.
In their fields she meets
The features of his pencil.
Onegin's soul is everywhere
He involuntarily expresses himself
Sometimes with a short word, then with a cross,
Then with a question hook.

And it starts a little bit
My Tatiana understand
It's clearer now
The one she sighs for
Condemned by a domineering fate:
A sad and dangerous eccentric,
The creation of hell or heaven,
This angel, this arrogant demon,
What about him? Is it imitation,
An insignificant ghost, or else
A Muscovite in a Harold's Raincoat,
Interpretation of other people's quirks,
Is there a full vocabulary of fashionable words?..
Is it not a parody?

Has she solved the riddle?
Has the word been found?
The clock is running; she forgot,
That they've been waiting for her at home for a long time,
Where are the two neighbors gathered
And where the conversation is about her.

The old woman said with a grunt.
After all, Olenka is younger than her.
It's time to get a girl, she-she, It's time; but what should I do with her? It's the same thing for everyone

I'm not coming. And she's still sad,
Yes, she wanders through the woods alone.

Into whom?
Buyanov wooed: refusal.
Ivan Petushkov too.
The Hussar Pykhtin was staying with us;
How he was attracted to Tanya,
How he crumbled like a small demon!
I thought: maybe it will go;
Where to! and again, the matter is apart.
Well, Mother? What happened?
To Moscow, to the bride fair!
I hear there are a lot of idle places.

Enough for one winter,
I'll at least give you a loan.

The old lady loved it very much
The advice is reasonable and good;
It oozed and immediately put it down
To go to Moscow in winter.
And Tanya hears this news.
To the court of the discerning light
Present clear features
Provincial simplicity,
And belated outfits,
And a belated warehouse of speeches;
Moscow dandies and circuses
Attract mocking glances!..
Oh fear! No, it's better and truer
She should stay in the wilderness of the forests.

Getting up at first light,
Now she's in a hurry to go to the fields
And, with tender eyes
Looking at them, he says:
Sorry, peaceful valleys,
And you, familiar mountain peaks,
And you, familiar forests;
I'm sorry, heavenly beauty,
Sorry, cheerful nature;
Changing the sweet, quiet light
To the noise of brilliant vanities
Forgive me, too, my freedom!
Where, why am I striving?
What does my fate promise me?

Her walks last a fraction of the time.
Now it's a hillock, then a stream
They stop involuntarily
Tatiana by her charm.
She's like with old friends.,
With its groves, meadows
Still in a hurry to talk.
But summer flies fast.
The golden autumn has come.
Nature is tremulous, pale,
Like a victim, magnificently decorated
Here's the north, catching up with the clouds,
He breathed, howled, and here she is
The sorceress winter is coming.

It came, scattered; in clumps
Hung on the branches of the oaks;
Lay down in wavy carpets
Among the fields, around the hills;
Brega with a motionless river
She leveled it with a plump veil;
Frost flashed. And we are glad
Mother Winter's pranks.
Only Tanya's heart is not happy with her.
She will not go to meet the winter,
To breathe in the frosty dust
And the first snow from the roof of the bathhouse
Wash your face, shoulders and chest:
Tatiana is afraid of the winter way.

The departure day is long overdue,
The deadline is also passing.
Inspected, re-upholstered, reinforced
An abandoned cart is forgotten.
The wagon train is ordinary, three caravans
They are carrying household belongings,
Pots, chairs, chests,
Jam in jars, mattresses,
Feather beds, cages with roosters,
Pots, basins et cetera,
Well, a lot of good stuff.
And here in the hut between the servants
There was a commotion, a farewell cry:
Eight nags were being led into the yard,

They are harnessed to the boyar wagon,
Chefs prepare breakfast,
The wagons are loaded with a mountain,
Women and coachmen are cursing.
On a skinny and shaggy nag
A bearded postilion is sitting,
The servants have come running to the gate
Saying goodbye to bars. And so
They sat down, and the venerable cart,
Sliding, crawls out the gate.
Sorry, peaceful places!
Sorry, the shelter is secluded!
Will I see you?.. And the stream came down
Tanya's eyes are streaming.

When the good enlightenment
Let's push back more boundaries,
Modern (by calculation
Philosophical tables,
Five hundred years later) roads, right,
We will change immensely:
Highway Russia here and here,
Having connected, they will cross.
Cast-iron bridges across the water
Step in a wide arc,
Push the mountains apart, under water
Proroem impudent vaults,
And he will lead a baptized world
There is a tavern at each station.

Now our roads are bad,
Forgotten bridges are rotting,
There are bedbugs and fleas at the stations
They don't give you a minute to fall asleep;
There are no inns. In a cold hut
Pompous, but hungry
For the sake of appearance, the price list is hanging
And futile teases the appetite,
Meanwhile, rural cyclopes
Before the slow fire
The Russian is treated with a hammer
From the lung of Europe,
Blessing the ruts
And the moats of the paternal land.

But winters are sometimes cold
The ride is pleasant and easy.
Like a verse without a thought in a fashionable song,
The winter road is smooth.
Automedons are our strikers,
Our threes are indefatigable,
And miles, to amuse the idle gaze,
They flash in my eyes like a fence.
Unfortunately, Larina was dragging,
Afraid of expensive runs,
Not on the post office, on their own,
And our virgin enjoyed it
The boredom of the road is quite:
They drove for seven days.

But it's really close. In front of them
The white stone of Moscow
Like the heat, with golden crosses
Old chapters are burning.
Ah, brothers! How pleased I was,
When churches and bell towers,
Gardens, palaces are a semicircle
Suddenly he opened up to me!
How often in a sad separation,
In my wandering destiny,
Moscow, I was thinking about you!
Moscow how much is in this sound
For the heart of the Russian it has merged!
How much it resonated!

Here, surrounded by his oak grove,
Petrovsky Castle. He's gloomy.
Recently, he is proud of his fame.
Napoleon waited in vain,
Intoxicated with the last happiness,
Moscow kneeling
With the keys of the old Kremlin:
No, my Moscow didn't go
To him with a guilty head.
Not a holiday, not an adopted gift,
She was preparing a fire
An impatient hero.
I'm out of here, immersed in the duma,
He looked at the menacing flame.

Farewell, witness of fallen glory,
Petrovsky Castle. Well! Don't stand there,
Go away! The pillars of the outpost are already there
They turn white: that's really on Tverskaya
The cart rushes through potholes.
Women flash past the booth,
Boys, shops, lanterns,
Palaces, gardens, monasteries,
Bukharans, sleighs, vegetable gardens,
Merchants, hovels, men,
Boulevards, towers, Cossacks,
Pharmacies, fashion stores,
Balconies, lions on the gates
And flocks of jackdaws on crosses.

In this tedious walk
An hour or two passes, and now
At Kharitonya's in the alley
A cart in front of the house at the gate
He stopped. To an old aunt,
The fourth year of the patient in consumption,
They have arrived now.
The door opens wide for them,
In glasses, in a tattered caftan,
With a stocking in his hand, a gray-haired Kalmyk.
Scream meets them in the living room
The Princess stretched out on the sofa.
The old ladies hugged each other crying,
And the exclamations poured out.



Who would have thought? How long ago!
For how long? Honey! Cousin!
Sit down as it is difficult!
By God, a scene from a novel


It's like I'm dreaming
Cousin, do you remember Grandison?
How, Grandison?.. Ah, Grandison!
Yes, I remember, I remember. Where is he?

He visited me on Christmas Eve;
He recently married his son.

And that one, but we'll tell you everything after,
Isn't it true? All her family
We'll show Tanya tomorrow.
It's a pity I don't have the time to drive around.;
I can barely drag my legs.
But you are exhausted from the road;
Let's go to rest together
Oh, there is no power
My joy is heavy now,
Not only sadness, my soul,
I'm no good at anything.
Life is so disgusting in old age
And here, I'm completely tired,
She coughed in tears.

Sick and fondling and fun
Tatiana is being touched; but she
It's not good for a housewarming party,
Accustomed to her room.
Under the silk curtain
She can't sleep in her new bed,
And the early ringing of the bells,
The forerunner of morning labors,
She gets out of bed.
Tanya sits down by the window.
The twilight is thinning; but she
She does not distinguish her fields:
An unfamiliar yard is in front of her,
Stable, kitchen and fence.

And so: for related dinners
Tanya is delivered every day
To present to the grandparents
Her absent-minded laziness.
Relatives who arrived from afar,
There is an affectionate meeting everywhere,
And exclamations, and bread and salt.
How Tanya has grown up! A long time ago
Didn't I baptize you?
And I took it in my arms like that!
And I was so hard on the ears!
And I fed it with gingerbread!
And the grandmothers repeat in chorus:

But there is no change in them;
Everything in them is based on the old pattern:
At the aunt of Princess Elena
The same tulle cap;
Everything is white Lukerya Lvovna,
The same lies Lyubov Petrovna,
Ivan Petrovich is just as stupid,
Semyon Petrovich is also stingy,
At Pelageya Nikolaevna's
The same friend Monsieur Finmouche,
And the same Pomeranian, and the same husband;
And he's still a good member of the club,
Still humble, just as deaf
And he also eats and drinks for two.

Their daughters hug Tanya.
The Younger Graces of Moscow
At first they look around in silence
Tatiana from head to toe;
They find her strange,
Provincial and simpering,
And something pale and thin,
But very good-looking;
Then, obeying nature,
They make friends with her, lead her to themselves,
Kiss her, gently shake her hands,
Fluff her curls according to fashion
And they chant
Secrets are heartfelt, secrets of virgins,

Other people's and their own victories,
Hopes, pranks, dreams.
Innocent conversations are flowing
With the embellishment of light slander.
Then, in return for babbling,
Her heartfelt confession
They tenderly demand one.
But Tanya, just like in a dream,
He hears their speeches without participation,
He doesn't understand anything,
And the secret of his heart,
A treasured treasure of tears and happiness,
Keeps silent meanwhile
And he doesn't share it with anyone.

Tatiana wants to listen
Into conversations, into a general conversation;
But everyone in the living room is occupied
Such incoherent, vulgar nonsense;
Everything about them is so pale, indifferent;
They slander even boring;
In the fruitless dryness of speeches,
Inquiries, gossip and news
Thoughts will not flare up for a whole day,
At least casually, at least at random;
A languid mind will not smile,
My heart will not tremble, even for a joke.
And even funny nonsense
You won't find it in you, the light is empty.

Archived young men in a crowd
They look at Tanya primly
And about her among themselves
They speak unfavorably.
Some kind of sad buffoon
He finds her perfect
And leaning against the door,
He's preparing an elegy for her.
I met Tanya at the boring aunt's,
Vyazemsky somehow got hooked on her
And I managed to occupy her soul.
And, near him, she was noticed,
About her, adjusting your wig,
The old man inquires.

But where Melpomene is stormy
A prolonged howl is heard,
Where he waves a tinsel mantle
She is in front of a cold crowd,
Where Thalia is quietly napping
And he does not listen to friendly splashes,
Where Terpsichore is the only one
The young viewer is amazed
(Which was also the case in previous years,
During your time and mine),
Did not apply to her
I will not give you jealous lorgnettes,
No tube of fashion connoisseurs
From the boxes and the chair rows.

It is also brought to the Assembly.
There's crowding, excitement, heat,
There is a roar of music, a sparkle of candles,
A flicker, a whirlwind of fast vapors,
Beauties light headdresses,
The choirs are full of people,
The bride is a vast semicircle,
All the senses are suddenly struck.
There seem to be smart people here
Your insolence, your vest
And an inattentive lorgnette.
Here are the Hussars on leave
They are in a hurry to appear, to thunder,
To shine, captivate and fly away.

The night has many lovely stars,
There are many beauties in Moscow.
But brighter than all the friends of heaven
The moon is in the air blue.
But the one that I dare not
To disturb with my lyre,
Like a majestic moon,
There is one shining among the wives and maidens.
With what heavenly pride
It touches the earth!
How full her breasts are!
How beautiful her wonderful gaze is!..
But come on, come on; stop it:
You have paid tribute to madness.

Noise, laughter, running, bowing,
Galloping, mazurka, waltz Meanwhile,
Between two aunts at the column,
Unnoticed by anyone,
Tatiana looks and does not see,
Hates the excitement of the light;
She's stuffy here, she's a dream
Aspires to a field life,
To the village, to the poor villagers,
To a secluded corner,
Where the bright stream flows,
To your flowers, to your novels
And into the twilight of the lime alleys,
To where he appeared to her.

So her thought wanders far away:
The light and the noisy ball are forgotten,
Meanwhile, he doesn't take his eyes off her
Some important general.
The aunts blinked at each other
And Tanya was elbowed at once,
And each one whispered to her:



In that pile, see? ahead,
Where there are two more in uniform
That's gone


But here we congratulate you on your victory
My dear Tatiana
And we will direct our way to the side,
So as not to forget who I'm singing about
By the way, there are two words about that here:
I'm singing a younger friend
And a lot of his quirks.
Bless my long work,
O you epic muse!
And, handing me the faithful staff,
Don't let me wander off at random.
Quite. Off with the burden!
I saluted classicism:
Although it's late, there is an introduction.


In those days when in the gardens of the Lyceum
I was blossoming serenely,
I read Apuleius willingly,
And I haven't read Cicero,
In those days in the mysterious valleys,
In the spring, with the clicks of the swan,
Near the waters that shone in silence,
The muse began to appear to me.
My student cell
Suddenly it dawned on me: the muse is in her
She opened a feast of young ideas,
Sang of children's fun,
And the glory of our antiquity,
And the hearts are trembling dreams.

And the light greeted her with a smile;
Success inspired us first;
Old Derzhavin noticed us
And when he went down to the coffin, he blessed him.


And I, imputing to myself the law
There is a single arbitrariness of passions,
Sharing feelings with the crowd,
I brought a frisky muse
To the noise of feasts and riotous disputes,
Thunderstorms of the midnight Watches;
And to them in crazy feasts
She carried her gifts
And how the bacchante frolicked,
She sang for the guests over the bowl,
And the youth of bygone days
She was following her wildly,
And I was proud among friends
My windy friend.

But I fell behind their union
And She ran after me into the distance.
How often is the affectionate muse
I was delighting in the path of the mute
The magic of a secret story!
How often on the rocks of the Caucasus
She is Lenore, in the moonlight,
She rode a horse with me!
How often is it on the shores of Taurida
She's got me in the dark of the night
She drove me to listen to the noise of the sea,
The incessant whisper of Nereida,
A deep, eternal chorus of shafts,
A hymn of praise to the father of the worlds.

And, having forgotten the capital of the far
And glitter and noisy feasts,
In the wilderness of Moldova sad
She is humble tents
I visited the wandering tribes,
And she went wild between them,
And I forgot the speech of the gods
For sparse, strange languages,
For the songs of the steppe, dear to her
Suddenly everything changed,
And here she is in my garden
She appeared as a young lady of the district,
With a sad thought in his eyes,
With a French book in his hands.

And now I am a muse for the first time
I'm bringing you to a social event;
On the charms of her steppe
I look at it with jealous shyness.
Through a tight row of aristocrats,
Military dandies, diplomats
And proud ladies she glides;
So she sat down quietly and looked,
Admiring the noisy crowding,
The flashing of dresses and speeches,
The slow appearance of guests
In front of the young mistress
And the dark frame of men
Around the ladies as near the paintings.

She likes the order slim
Oligarchic conversations,
And the cold of calm pride,
And this mixture of ranks and years.
But who is this in the chosen crowd
Is it silent and foggy?
He seems like a stranger to everyone.
Faces flash in front of him
Like a series of annoying ghosts.
What, spleen or suffering arrogance
In his face? Why is he here?
Who is he? Is it really Eugene?
Is it really him?.. That's right, he is.
How long has it been brought to us?

Is he still the same or has he been pacified?
Or is he also acting like a weirdo?
Tell me: how did he return?
What will he present to us so far?
What will it be now? Melmotte,
A cosmopolitan, a patriot,
Harold, a Quaker, a prude,
Or someone else flaunts a mask,
Or just be a good guy,
How are you and I, like the whole world?
At least my advice
Is to get behind the run-down fashion.
He had fooled the light enough
Yes and no.

Why is it so unfavorable
Do you speak about him?
For the fact that we are restless
We are busy, we judge everything,
That ardent souls are careless
Selfish insignificance
Or offends, or makes you laugh,
That the mind, loving space, is cramping,
That there are too many conversations
We are happy to accept for business,
That stupidity is windy and evil,
That nonsense is important to important people
And that mediocrity is the only one
Are we up to the task and not strange?

Blessed is he who was young when he was young,
Blessed is he who matured in time,
Who is gradually getting cold in life
He was able to endure with the years;
Who has not indulged in strange dreams,
Who was no stranger to the secular rabble,
Who was a dandy or a grabber at the age of twenty,
And at thirty he is advantageously married;
Who was released at fifty
From private and other debts,
Who has fame, money and ranks
Calmly I got in line,
Who has been talked about for a century:
N. N. is a wonderful person.

But it's sad to think that it's in vain
We were given youth,
That they cheated on her every hour,
That she deceived us;
What are our best wishes,
What are our fresh dreams
Decayed in a quick succession,
Like leaves rotten in autumn.
It's unbearable to see in front of you
There is a long row of dinners alone,
To look at life as a rite of passage,
And following the orderly crowd
To go without sharing with her
No common opinions, no passions.

The subject of noisy judgments,
Unbearable (agree on that)
Between reasonable people
To be known as a fake weirdo,
Or a sad madcap,
Or a satanic freak,
Or even my demon.
Onegin (I'll take care of him again),
By killing a friend in a duel,
Having lived without a goal, without labors
Until the age of twenty-six,
Languishing in idle leisure
No service, no wife, no business,
He couldn't do anything.

He became restless,
Hunting for a change of places
(A very painful property)
(A voluntary cross).
He left his village,
Forests and fields of solitude,
Where is the bloody shadow
She appeared to him every day,
And he began to wander without a purpose,
Accessible to feeling alone;
And travel to him,
Like everything in the world, tired of;
He came back and got,
Like Chatsky, from the ship to the ball.

But now the crowd hesitated,
A whisper ran through the hall
The lady was approaching the hostess,
An important general is behind her.
She was unhurried,
Not cold, not talkative,
Without a brazen look for everyone,
Without pretensions to success,
Without these little antics,
Without imitative ideas
Everything was quiet, it was just in her,
She seemed like the right shot
Du comme faut (Shishkov, I'm sorry:
I don't know how to translate it.)

The ladies moved closer to her;
The old ladies smiled at her;
The men bowed lower,
Caught the gaze of her eyes;
The girls were quieter
In front of her in the hall, and all above
He raised his nose and shoulders
The general who entered with her.
No one could have made her beautiful
To name; but from head to toe
No one could have found it in her
The fact that fashion is autocratic
In the high London circle
It's called idag. (I can't

I really love this word,
But I can't translate it;
It is still new to us,
And it is unlikely to be in his honor.
It would be suitable in an epigram)
But I'm talking to our lady.
She is sweet with careless charm,
She was sitting at the table
With the brilliant Nina Voronskaya,
This Cleopatra of the Neva;
And that's right, you would agree,
That Nina is a marble beauty
She couldn't outshine her neighbor,
At least she was dazzling.

Is she really? But for sure
How! From the wilderness of steppe villages
And an obtrusive lorgnette
He's paying attention every minute
The one whose appearance vaguely reminded
He has forgotten features.
Tell me, Prince, don't you know,
Who's there in the crimson beret
Does he speak to the Spanish ambassador?
The Prince looks at Onegin.
Yeah! It's been a long time since you've been in the world.
Wait, I'll introduce you.

So you're married! I didn't know about the wound!
How long has it been?

The Prince is coming
To his wife and brings her
My family and my friend.
The Princess looks at him
And whatever confused her soul,
No matter how strong she was
Surprised, amazed,
But nothing changed her:
It retains the same tone,
Her bow was just as quiet.

By God! Not that she shuddered.
Or she suddenly became pale, red
She didn't even move an eyebrow.;
She didn't even press her lips together.
Although he looked at it, he couldn't be more diligent,
But there are also traces of Tatiana the former
Onegin could not find it.
He wanted to start a conversation with her
And he couldn't. She asked if he had been here long, where he came from

And isn't it one of their sides?
Then she turned to her husband
Tired look; slipped out
And he remained motionless.

Is that really the same Tatiana,
Which he is alone with,
At the beginning of our novel,
In the remote, distant side,
In the good heat of moralizing,
I once read the instructions,
The one from which he keeps
The letter where the heart speaks,
Where everything is safe, everything is free,
That girl, or is it a dream?..
That girl he's
Neglected in a humble way,
Have you been with him just now
So indifferent, so brave?

He leaves the party cramped,
He goes home thoughtfully;
A dream that is sad, then charming
He is disturbed by his late sleep.
He woke up; they brought him
Letter: Prince N humbly requests
It's for the evening. God! to her!..
Oh, I will, I will! And soon
He defiles the courteous answer.
What's wrong with him? What a strange dream he's in!
What stirred in the depths
Cold and lazy souls?
Annoyance? vanity? or again
The care of youth is love?

Onegin is counting the clock again,
He won't wait for the day to end again.
But ten o'clock strikes; he leaves,
He flew, he's at the porch,
He enters the Princess with trepidation;
He finds Tatiana alone,
And together for a few minutes
They're sitting. The words won't come
From the mouth of Onegin. Sullen,
Awkward, he's barely
He answers her. Head
His is full of stubborn thought.
He stares stubbornly: she
She sits quietly and is free.

The husband comes. He interrupts
This unpleasant tete-a-tete;
With Onegin, he recalls
Pranks, jokes of former years.
They're laughing. The guests enter.
Here is a large salt of secular anger
The conversation began to revive;
A little nonsense in front of the hostess
Sparkled without silly affectation,
And interrupted him in the meantime
A reasonable sense without vulgar topics,
Without eternal truths, without pedantry,
And he didn't scare anyone's ears.
By his free vivacity.

There was, however, the color of the capital,
And know and fashion patterns,
There are foxes everywhere,
Necessary fools;
There were elderly ladies here
In caps and roses, they look evil;
There were several girls here,
Not smiling faces;
There was a messenger who spoke
About public affairs;
He was wearing fragrant gray hair here
The old man, joking in the old way:
Superbly subtle and clever,
Which is kind of funny these days.

He was a sucker for epigrams here,
An angry gentleman for everything:
The master's tea is too sweet,
On the plane of the ladies, on the tone of the men,
On the rumors about the misty novel,
On the monogram, given to two sisters,
On the lies of magazines, on the war,
At the snow and at his wife.


There was Prolasov, who deserved
Fame for the baseness of the soul,
In all albums, blunted,
St.-Rest, your pencils;
There is another dictator in the doorway.
He stood like a magazine picture,
Blushing like a palm cherub,
Tightened, mute and motionless,
And the traveler is a stray,
Starched brute,
He excited a smile at a party
With his caring posture,
And silently exchanged glances
He was given a general sentence.

But my Onegin evening is whole
I was busy with Tatiana alone,
Not this timid girl,
In love, poor and simple,
But an indifferent princess,
But an unapproachable goddess
The magnificent, regal Neva.
O people! You all look alike
To the ancestress Eva:
What is given to you does not attract
You, the serpent constantly calls you
To myself, to the mysterious tree;
Give you the forbidden fruit:
And without that, heaven is not heaven for you.

How Tatiana has changed!
How firmly she has entered into her role!
As an oppressive dignity
I've accepted the receptions soon!
Who would dare to look for a gentle girl
In this majestic, in this careless
The legislator's room?
And he worried her heart!
She's talking about him in the dark of the night,
Until Morpheus arrives,
Used to be virginally sad,
Languid eyes are raised to the moon,
Dreaming with him someday
To complete the humble way of life!

All ages are submissive to love;
But to young, virgin hearts
Her impulses are beneficial,
Like storms in the fields:
In the rain of passions, they are fresh,
They are both being updated and maturing
And a powerful life gives
Both the lush color and the sweet fruit.
But at a late age and infertile,
At the turn of our years,
Sad is the dead trail of passion:
So the storms of autumn are cold
A meadow is turned into a swamp
And they expose the forest around.

There is no doubt: alas! Evgeniy
I'm in love with Tatiana like a child;
In the anguish of love thoughts
He spends both day and night.
Mind not heeding strict penalties,
To her porch, the glass vestibule
He drives up every day;
He's chasing her like a shadow.;
He's happy if he throws it at her
Fluffy boa on the shoulder,
Or it will touch you hotly
Her hands, or spread them apart
Before her is a motley regiment of liveries,
Or the handkerchief will lift it up.

She doesn't notice him.,
No matter how hard he fights, even if he dies.
Freely accepts at home,
When visiting with him, he says three words,
Sometimes he will meet you with a bow,
Sometimes he won't notice at all:
There is not a drop of coquetry in her
He is not tolerated by the upper class.
Onegin begins to turn pale:
She can't see it, or she's not sorry;
Onegin dries up and barely
He's not suffering from consumption.
Everyone sends Onegin to the doctors,
They send him to the waters in unison.

But he's not going; he's ahead of time
I am ready to write to my great-grandfathers
About an early meeting; and Tatiana
And there is no case (their gender is like that);
And he is stubborn, he does not want to fall behind,
He still hopes, he is busy;
Be brave, healthy, sick,
To the Princess with a weak hand
He's writing a passionate message.
At least it's not much use at all
He didn't see anything in the letters.;
But, to know, heartache
It has already come to him unbearably.
Here is his letter exactly to you.
Onegin's letter to Tatiana
I foresee everything: you will be offended
There is an explanation for the sad mystery.
What a bitter contempt
Your proud look will portray!
What do I want? for what purpose
Will I open my soul to you?
What kind of malicious fun,
Maybe I'm giving you an excuse!
I met you by chance sometime,
I notice a spark of tenderness in you,
I didn't dare to believe her:
I didn 't give the sweet habit a go;
His abominable freedom
I didn't want to lose it.
One more thing separated us
Lensky fell an unfortunate victim
From everything that is sweet to the heart,
Then I tore off my heart;
A stranger to everyone, not bound by anything,
I thought: freedom and peace
A substitute for happiness. Oh my God!
How I made a mistake, how I was punished.
No, I see you every minute,
Follow you everywhere,
The smile of the mouth, the movement of the eyes
To catch with loving eyes,
To listen to you for a long time, to understand
Your soul is all your perfection,
To freeze in agony before you,
To pale and fade away is bliss!
And I am deprived of that: for you
I go everywhere at random;
The day is dear to me, the hour is dear to me:
And I'm wasting my time in vain
The days counted by fate.
And they are so painful.
I know: my age has already been measured;
But to prolong my life,
I have to be sure in the morning,
That I'll see you in the afternoon
I'm afraid: in my humble prayer
He will see your stern gaze
The schemes of a despicable cunning
And I hear your angry reproach.
When would you know how terrible it is
Longing for love,
To burn with reason every hour
To subdue the excitement in the blood;
To want to hug your knees
And, sobbing, at your feet
Pour out pleas, confessions, penalties,
Everything, everything that I could express,
Meanwhile, with a feigned cold
Arming both speech and gaze,
Have a calm conversation,
To look at you with a cheerful look!..
But so be it: I'm on my own
I can't resist anymore;
It's all settled: I'm at your will
And I surrender to my fate.

There is no answer. He's a messenger again:
The second, the third letter
There is no answer. In one assembly
He's on his way; just let him in
She's coming towards me. How harsh!
They don't see him, not a word with him;
U! How is it surrounded now
She is the Epiphany cold!
How to keep resentment
Stubborn mouths want to!
Onegin fixed his sharp gaze:
Where, where is the confusion, compassion?
Where are the tear stains?.. They are not there, they are not there!
There is only a trace of anger on this face

Yes, maybe the fear of secrecy,
So that the husband or the light did not guess
Leprosy, occasional weakness
Everything that my Onegin knew
There is no hope! He's leaving,
He curses his madness
And, it is deeply immersed in,
He renounced the light again.
And in the silent office
He remembered it was time,
When there is a severe melancholy
He was being chased in a noisy light,
I caught it, took it by the collar
And locked it in a dark corner.

He began to read again indiscriminately.
He read Gibbon, Rousseau,
Manzoni, Herder, Chamfort,
Madame de Stae, Bichat, Tissot,
I read the skeptical White,
I read the works of Fontenelle,
I read some of our books,
Not rejecting anything:
Both almanacs and magazines,
Where are the teachings they tell us,
Where do they scold me like that nowadays,
And where are the madrigals
I have sometimes met myself:
E sempre bene, gentlemen.

And what about it? His eyes read,
But my thoughts were far away;
Dreams, desires, sorrows
They pressed deep into the soul.
It is between the printed lines
I read with spiritual eyes
Other lines. He's in them.
It was completely deepened.
Those were secret legends
Warm, dark old days,
Unrelated dreams,
Threats, rumors, predictions,
Or a long tale of living nonsense,
Or letters from a young virgin.

And gradually put to sleep
He falls into both feelings and thoughts,
And in front of him is imagination
The pharaoh is throwing his motley sword.
That's what he sees: on the melted snow,
It's like sleeping at night,
The young man lies motionless,
And hears a voice: well? dead.
Then he sees the forgotten enemies,
Slanderers, and evil cowards,
And a swarm of young traitors,
And the circle of despicable comrades,
That's a country house and by the window
She's sitting there and that's it!..

He's so used to getting lost in this,
That I almost went crazy
Or he didn't become a poet.
To admit it: I would have borrowed it!
And for sure: by the power of magnetism
Poems of the Russian mechanism
Almost at that time I did not comprehend
My stupid student.
How he looked like a poet,
When there was one sitting in the corner,
And there was a fireplace burning in front of him,
And he was purring: You're right.
Or do mo and dropped
Into the fire, then a shoe, then a magazine.

The days raced by; the air was heated
Winter has already been resolved;
And he didn't become a poet.,
He didn't die, he didn't go crazy.
Spring brings him to life: for the first time
Their rooms are locked,
Where he wintered like a groundhog,
Double windows, fireplaces
He leaves on a clear morning,
Rushes along the Neva River in a sleigh.
On blue, excised ice
The sun is playing; it's melting dirty
There is snow on the streets.
Where does your fast running go on it

Is Onegin striving? You are in advance
You guessed it; that's right:
He rushed to her, to his Tatiana
My uncorrected weirdo.
He looks like a dead man.
There is not a single soul in the hallway.
He's in the hall; next: no one.
He opened the door. Well, his
Is it striking with such force?
The Princess is in front of him, alone,
Sitting, not cleaned, pale,
He's reading some kind of letter
And quietly tears are pouring down like a river,
Leaning on his hand with his cheek.

Oh, who would mute her suffering
I didn't read it in that quick moment!
Who is the old Tanya, poor Tanya
Now I wouldn't recognize the princess!
In the anguish of insane regrets
Eugene fell at her feet;
She shuddered and was silent;
And he looks at Onegin
Without surprise, without anger
His sick, faded gaze,
A pleading look, a mute reproach,
Everything is clear to her. A simple maiden,
With dreams, the heart of the old days,
Now she's resurrected in her again.

She doesn't pick it up
And without taking my eyes off him,
It does not take away from greedy lips
His unfeeling hand
What is her dream now?
A long silence passes,
And finally she quietly says:
Get up. I must
You need to explain yourself frankly.
Onegin, do you remember that hour,
When in the garden, in the alley of us
Fate brought me together, and so humbly
Did I hear your lesson?
It's my turn today.

Onegin, I was younger then,
I think I was better.,
And I loved you; so what?
What have I found in your heart?
What is the answer? one severity.
Isn't it true? It wasn't news to you
A humble girl's love?
And now the blood is getting cold,
As soon as I remember the look is cold
And this sermon But you
I don't blame: in that terrible hour
You did a noble thing.,
You were right in front of me:
I am grateful with all my soul

Then in the desert,
Away from the fuss of rumor,
You didn't like me Well now
Are you following me?
Why do you have me in mind?
Is it not because in high society
Now I have to come;
That I am rich and noble,
That the husband was mutilated in battles,
What are we being caressed by the yard for?
Is it not because my shame
Now I would be noticed by everyone,
And he could have been in the company of a prince
Would you like a tempting honor?

I'm crying if your Tanya
You haven't forgotten until now,
Then know: the barb of your abuse,
A cold, stern conversation,
If only I had the power,
I would prefer an offensive passion.
And these letters and tears.
To my infant dreams
Then at least you had pity,
At least respect for the years
And now! What's at my feet
What brings you here? What a little thing!
How is it with your heart and mind
Being a petty slave's feelings?

And to me, Onegin, this splendor,
A miserable life of tinsel,
My progress in the vortex of light,
My fashion house and evenings,
What's in them? I'm glad to give it back now
All this rags of the masquerade,
All this glitter, and noise, and smoke
For a shelf of books, for a wild garden,
For our poor home,
For those places where the first time,
Onegin, I saw you,
Yes, for the humble cemetery,
Where are the cross and the shadow of the branches today
Over my poor nurse

And happiness was so possible,
So close!.. But my fate
It's already been solved. Careless,
Maybe I did it:
Me with tears of spells
My mother begged; for poor Tanya
All the lots were equal
I got married. You must,
I'm asking you to leave me;
I know: in your heart there is
And pride and direct honor.
I love you (why lie?),
But I'm given to someone else.;
I will be faithful to him forever.

She's gone. It's worth it Eugene,
As if thunderstruck.
What a storm of sensations
Now he is immersed in his heart!
But the spurs did not ring,
And Tatiana's husband showed up,
And here is my hero,
In a moment that was evil for him,
Reader, we will leave now,
For a long time forever. It's
Enough for us to follow one path
We wandered around the world. Congratulations
Each other with the shore. Hurray!
It would have been a long time ago (wouldn't it?) It's time!

Whoever you are, oh my reader,
Friend, foe, I want to be with you
To break up now as a friend.
Sorry. Why would you follow me
Here I did not look for careless stanzas,
Are there any rebellious memories,
Rest from labors,
Tableaux vivants, or sharp words,
Or grammatical errors,
God grant that in this book you
For entertainment, for dreams,
For the heart, for magazine bumps
Although I could find a grain.
We'll break up for this, I'm sorry!

Forgive me, my strange companion,
And you, my faithful ideal,
And you, a living and constant,
Albeit a small work. I knew with you
All that is enviable for a poet:
The oblivion of life in the storms of light,
A sweet conversation of friends.
Many, many days have passed
Since the young Tatiana
And Onegin is with her in a vague dream
Appeared to me for the first time
And the distance of a free novel
I'm through a magic crystal
I haven't clearly distinguished it yet.

But those who are in a friendly meeting
I read the first stanzas
There are no others, but those are far away,
As Sadi once said.
Without them, Onegin is finished.
And the one with whom he is educated
Tatiana's sweet ideal
Oh, a lot, a lot of rock has gone away!
Blessed is he who celebrates life early
I left it without finishing it to the bottom
A glass full of wine,
Who hasn't read her novel
And suddenly he knew how to part with it,
As I am with my Onegin.
